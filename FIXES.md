# ðŸ”§ FIXES APPLIED - Both Issues Resolved!

## Issue 1: Sign Out Button Not Working âœ…

**Problem:** Sign out button wasn't attached to the signOut() function

**Root Cause:** 
- Event listener was trying to attach before the button existed in the DOM
- Button is only created when student dashboard is shown

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved sign out button event listener INSIDE `initStudent()` function
- Added check to prevent duplicate event listeners (`__bound` flag)
- Button now works immediately when student UI is displayed

**Test:**
1. Login with student email
2. Click "Sign Out" button in top-right
3. âœ… Should clear localStorage and reload to login screen


## Issue 2: PantherBot Send Button Not Working âœ…

**Problem:** Send button wasn't responding to clicks

**Root Cause:**
- Duplicate initializer code in pantherbot.js
- Import statement was in the middle of the file instead of at top
- Module imports must come before any other code

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved `import { OPENAI_API_KEY } from "./apiKey.js"` to top of file
- Removed duplicate initializer code
- Proper initialization sequence: import â†’ functions â†’ event listeners
- Added automatic detection of localhost vs Vercel for API calls

**Test:**
1. Open PantherBot tab
2. Type "hi" in the input field
3. Click "Send" button or press Enter
4. âœ… Should get response from PantherBot


## Files Modified:

### 1. `main/index.html`
- âœ… Added helper functions (`$` and `$$`) at top of script
- âœ… Moved sign out button initialization into `initStudent()`
- âœ… Removed broken DOMContentLoaded listener

### 2. `pantherbot/pantherbot.js`
- âœ… Moved import statement to top of file
- âœ… Removed duplicate initializer code
- âœ… Fixed proper module structure
- âœ… Added environment detection for API endpoint

### 3. `api/chat.js` (NEW - for Vercel)
- âœ… Created serverless function for OpenAI API
- âœ… Handles CORS properly
- âœ… Reads API key from environment variable


## Deploy to Vercel:

1. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = (your key from pantherbot/apiKey.js)

2. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix sign out and PantherBot buttons"
   git push
   ```

3. **Vercel Auto-Deploys!**


## Test Locally with Live Server:

1. Make sure Python server is running (for API):
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\chase\OneDrive\Desktop\schoolappproject\portledge_dashboard_v9
   python server.py
   ```

2. Start Live Server in VS Code (Right-click main/index.html â†’ Open with Live Server)

3. Test both features:
   - âœ… Sign out button works
   - âœ… PantherBot send button works


## Both Issues FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

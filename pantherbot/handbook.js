Foreword

Welcome to Portledge School! We look forward to a stimulating year as teachers, parents/guardians and students work together to take full advantage of the school‚Äôs resources. Whether you are a family new to the Upper School or have experience in each of our divisions, we encourage you to read this Handbook thoroughly. It addresses both general expectations and practical considerations.

As a small school, we are able to encourage individuality and independence in our students while stressing each student‚Äôs responsibility and commitment to Portledge. Our diversity builds a spirit of community that complements and reinforces the skills and experience of the faculty. Our beautiful campus provides a wonderful setting for learning: we count on everyone to maintain as well as appreciate it.


Parents should always address any academic concerns directly with the teacher first. Communication with teachers, deans, and advisors is also encouraged, but only after direct contact with the teacher has occurred. The student's advisor or dean can also be helpful in arranging a parent-teacher conference, directing the parent to the appropriate person for information or in answering questions. This document can be a helpful resource for finding the right person to contact in different situations: Who Do I Contact?  .

Your child's Dean acts as the primary liaison between you and the school, similar to an Advisor, but solely dedicated to ensuring success and wellness for your child at each step of their Upper School journey. Alongside your child's Advisor, the Dean can and should help facilitate any necessary meetings between parents/guardians and teachers and can also help generally ensure that parents/guardians and their children are making full and appropriate use of the myriad resources available to them.

If there are certain at-home dynamics that might be affecting a child‚Äôs performance, or if there are confidential issues that need to be discussed, parents should feel free to contact any member of the child‚Äôs ‚Äòteam,‚Äô including the Division Director, Assistant Division Director, School Psychologists, Dean and/or Advisor.

A constructive and open dialogue between parents and school can only help to strengthen the educational process for the child. Our goal is to foster the academic and personal growth of each student. 

We are excited to be working with you!

Disclaimer
Please note that the contents of this handbook in no way limit the authority of Portledge School to deviate from the normal rules and procedures set forth in this handbook and to approach individual circumstances as they arise in the manner deemed most appropriate by the School, taking into consideration the best interests of the School, its faculty, employees, students, and/or the overall school community. The policies contained in this handbook may also be revised or updated periodically before, during, and after the school year.

Portledge School Mission Statement
Portledge School offers a competitive college preparatory experience in a warm and inclusive community.  Students are inspired to realize their individual potential by developing the critical thinking skills and moral courage necessary for lifelong learning in an increasingly complex world.

Portledge School Philosophy
Portledge is an independent, pre-nursery through 12th grade coeducational, college-preparatory day school. The School‚Äôs coordinated sequential program provides an academically excellent education that prepares students for responsible and productive lives. Dedicated teachers, small class sizes, and a warm and personal atmosphere combine to advance high moral standards and individual accomplishments.
 
In accordance with these principles, the School:
develops skills in reading, writing, arithmetic, and technology in order to provide a strong foundation for advanced work in the disciplines of English, mathematics, foreign languages, history, and science;
fosters aesthetic appreciation and individual talent through programs in art, music, and drama; 
promotes physical fitness, athletic abilities, and sportsmanship through programs in physical education and interscholastic athletics;
supports sustaining the environment through outdoor education programs, studies in ecology, and conservation practices; 
upholds the values of accountability, self-discipline, and cooperation through teacher-student relationships and clearly defined standards; 
instills the spirit of responsible citizenship through participation in extracurricular activities and service to the school and the broader community;
expects a commitment to the School shared by students, teachers, and families. 

To these ends, Portledge encourages in each student the lifelong fascination for learning and the development of character and intellectual courage which are the hallmarks of a truly educated citizen.


School Closings
During the winter months, closures of the physical campus due to unsafe driving conditions are announced on the school website (www.portledge.org), by email, and on the phone answering machine (516) 750-3100. If you live in Nassau County or Suffolk County, you will also be able to see school closings on News Channel 12. If you live outside of Nassau County or Suffolk County, you can access News 12 on the internet and check for Portledge School. SMS (short messaging system) is used to text message families on their cell phones in the event of an unanticipated school closing, as well. 

At times, these campus closures may result in days of fully online instruction; on other occasions, such closures will result in days on which no instruction occurs (e.g., traditional ‚Äòsnow days‚Äô). Details concerning how campus closures will be managed will be shared with members of the school community as those details become available, and decisions concerning this management will be made by Portledge Administration on a case-by-case basis. 

Should parents have any doubts about the advisability of driving, do not hesitate to keep children at home, even if school is open. In the event of a school closure or a national or local emergency where the school is forced to close or make alternate plans to operate, tuition will not be refunded and will remain due in full.

School Hours and Attendance


8:20 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.
Academic day
8:20 a.m.
While classes begin at 8:20 a.m., students are encouraged to arrive early enough to prepare for the day. Students are expected to be in their seats at the start of first-period class. All Upper School students are expected to be here by 8:20 a.m. unless they have no first-period class. The attendance of record will be taken for the day during Advisory. On Mondays, Advisory takes place from 9:46 a.m. to 9:56 am. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, Advisory takes place from 10:26 a.m. to 10:36 a.m.  On Fridays, Advisory takes place from 10:58 a.m. to 11:08 am. Students who are late to their first obligation of the day (whether that is a class, Advisory, or Community Time) must sign in at the Upper School Office before proceeding to class. Failure to do so will result in an infraction. Infractions and consequences are explained later in this document. 
3:30 p.m.
Classes end
3:40 p.m.
Buses depart promptly
3:45 p.m.‚Äì7:30 p.m.

Departure from School 
Students not participating in after-school sports, after-school help sessions, or other activities are dismissed at 3:30 p.m.  Students who remain after school and are not driving themselves home should not leave campus until a bus or an approved ride takes them home. Students who miss their scheduled school bus departures should be prepared to secure alternate transportation for themselves. If they have issues doing so, they should contact Ms. Balsam (pbalsam@portledge.org) and Mr. Intreglia (aintreglia@portledge.org) for assistance.

Attendance 
Any questions or concerns regarding any aspects of policies and practices around attendance should be directed to Ms. Peggy Balsam (pbalsam@portledge.org) and/or Mrs. Susan Simon (ssimon@portledge.org). 

In alignment with substantial equivalency for Locust Valley Central School District:
The following are considered valid reasons for absence from school; absences for the below reasons will be considered ‚Äúexcused‚Äù, provided that they are accompanied by written notification of relevant divisional personnel by parents/guardians in writing of day absences. Such written notification should be delivered to the relevant divisional personnel by no later than 8:00 a.m. on the day of an absence. Such an excuse should contain the reason and date of absence.
sickness or death in the family;
impassable roads or weather making travel unsafe;
religious observance;
illness of the pupil;
approved school-sponsored trips;
quarantine;
required court appearances;
serious contagious or epidemic disease in the household where the pupil resides;
examination for a driving permit or road test (or other state required testing); 
doctor or dentist appointments which cannot be arranged any other time;
with reasonable notice, as defined by timely completion of a planned absence form, education-related appointments or commitments that cannot be arranged outside of school hours;
college interviews, when approved in advance by the school administration;
for cooperative work programs when approved by the school administration; 
military obligations;
ADA (IEP / 501 plan related absences); and
other reasons are determined by relevant divisional leadership in concert with divisional attendance personnel.
Any other absences are considered unexcused. 
Please note the following non-exhaustive list of invalid excuses for absences:
oversleeping;
missing the bus;
vacation trips and/or visiting relatives or friends;
babysitting and or helping at home;
shopping;
education-related appointments or commitments not accompanied by reasonable notice, as defined by timely completion of a planned absence form;
personal grooming/beautification commitments and appointments;
studying; 
truancy;
untimely / delinquent notification of absence;
working; and
leaving school during the day, including lunch, without proper notification.
Parents/guardians are responsible for notifying relevant divisional personnel in writing of day absences. Such written notification should be delivered to the relevant divisional personnel by no later than 8:00 a.m. on the day of an absence. Such an excuse should contain the reason and date of absence.
Any student not present at school for two or more consecutive school days, whose parents/guardians do not provide any excuses for absence, and whose parents/guardians are not responsive and available when the school attempts to reach them will be considered AWOL, and the school will contact the appropriate local and/or state authorities to help ensure the welfare of the pupil in question.
Any student not present at school for five or more consecutive school days whose parents/guardians have indicated that the reason for absence is health-related will be expected to produce a note from a physician in order to return to campus.
Any student not present at school for twenty consecutive school days will have their parent/guardian and home district notified of the absences in order to make determinations regarding continued enrollment and other possible next steps.
Adequate presence for a school day will be defined as student presence on campus for at least one scheduled obligation prior to 10:00 a.m. at the Lower and Early Childhood levels and by the time Advisory attendance is taken at the Middle and Upper School levels. 
Where excessive, unexcused absence persists, the pupil and parent will be notified in writing of the concern, and other steps may follow as divisionally appropriate (defined below). 
Persistent absence is defined as 12 unexcused absences by the end of the first semester or 24 by the end of the school year.
At all divisional levels, persistent unexcused absence may result in holding or withdrawal of re-enrollment contracts and/or other disciplinary action deemed appropriate by the school, including a disciplinary review of aforementioned student's attendance.
At the Upper School level, persistent unexcused absence may result in a credit viability review hearing by the Administrative Discipline Committee (ADC). The parents/guardians and student in this instance would be welcomed to appear before the ADC to adequately account for the unexcused absences in order to discuss and work toward appropriate credit accrual for courses in which the student is enrolled. In such cases, credit accrual may depend on completion of work and seat time outside the bounds of the regular school day and/or school year, at the discretion of the ADC.
At all divisional levels, persistent tardiness for school-day obligations may result in disciplinary action deemed appropriate by the school.
Persistent tardiness is defined as 20 tardies by the end of the first semester or 40 by the end of the school year.
 
Students who arrive late and sign in at the office must then proceed immediately to their scheduled obligation. The ‚Äòabsent‚Äô entry  will be changed to ‚Äòlate‚Äô when the daily record is finalized. If a note from a doctor is handed in at sign-in or there is a pre-arranged agreement on file, that information will be noted.
All students who do not have a class obligation prior to their daily Advisory session must be on time for Advisory. Similarly, students with a mandatory community-time obligation (i.e., Mandatory Conference Time, College Counseling Class, Class Meeting, or Town Meeting) that occurs prior to their Advisory session must be on time for that obligation. All students marked absent for either of the first two class periods of the day or their Advisory will have automatic calls go out to parents/guardians by noon. Please note that these calls and any accompanying email messages are a matter of accountability for the school; if parents/guardians have already been in touch with Mrs. Simon and/or Ms. Balsam regarding an absence for their child, there is no need for further action on their part. However, if parents/guardians have not previously been in touch with either of them regarding such an absence and they do receive such a notification,  they should immediately contact Mrs. Simon and/or Ms. Balsam in order to clarify the reason for the absence. All absences will remain on the student‚Äôs record and unexplained absences will be addressed as needed by Upper School Administration.
9th, 10th, and 11th grade students are expected to remain on campus from the time of their arrival until the official school day ends at 3:30 p.m.  For Seniors, special privileges begin in the fall at the discretion of the Upper School Director.  These privileges, when activated, allow Seniors whose parents have submitted approval via the Senior Off-Campus Permission Form to sign out and leave campus once during a free period or lunch period and to leave early for the day if their classes have ended. Seniors must sign in and out at all times. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to potential loss of Senior Privileges, at the discretion of the Upper School Director.
Any student who leaves school early without permission from a parent/guardian and a member of the Upper School Office will  incur appropriate consequences.
If a child is sick and needs to leave school, permission to be dismissed early can only come from the school nurse, Susan Simon, Peggy Balsam, Chris Disimile, or Francisco Lameiro. One of these individuals will communicate with the child‚Äôs parents/guardians prior to the child‚Äôs leaving early.
A student may not participate in an after-school activity if they fail to attend any of their on-campus obligations during the school day. These obligations include scheduled classes, Advisory, and Community Time. Further, students who fail to arrive on campus by 10:30 a.m. on a given day are barred from participation in any after-school Portledge activities on that day. After-school activities include, but are not limited to, athletic practices or contests, music practices or concerts, drama practices or performances, art shows, and/or other school-sponsored extracurricular activities. These rules around participation can only be waived at the discretion of the Dean of Students and with a valid written excuse, such as a doctor‚Äôs note, provided by a parent/guardian.

Sign In/Sign Out
Keeping track of students is a major responsibility of every adult on campus. Parents/guardians drive students to school; some students drive themselves to school; others arrive by bus. The same holds true when departing from campus. Students and parents/guardians must abide by the sign in / sign out policy. Any time a student arrives at campus late for their first obligation of the day or leaves prior to 3:30 p.m., they must sign in or out in the Upper School Office. Please note that, with the exception of Seniors making use of their off-campus privilege, students are not allowed to sign out until a parent/guardian has given permission by notifying the Upper School office via note, telephone, or email. Additionally, students will make use of School ID‚Äôs via our SchoolPass system both in the Upper School Office and at the Guardbooth. Students must be prepared to show ID at all times and be aware that failure to appropriately sign in and out will have consequences both in terms of ability to smoothly navigate campus life and in terms of disciplinary follow-up as needed.

Lateness and Absences
Students who are chronically late and/or chronically absent will face disciplinary action from the Upper School office and academic consequences at the discretion of the instructor, which would likely include no makeup privileges, no extra help offered, or grade reductions on specific assignments. For particularly egregious instances, the administration reserves the right to determine academic consequences, potentially overruling or disregarding the instructor's chosen consequences.

Any student deemed to be excessively late to any combination of school obligations will serve detention. Further issues in this respect following an initial detention may incur more stringent consequences. Detention will be explained further later in this document. 

Students will serve a subsequent detention for every unexcused class absence that occurs. Persistent issues involving unexcused absences will likely result in more stringent consequences.

Portledge believes in the importance of attending class, while recognizing the value of extracurricular activities. We allow students to miss classes in order to travel and attend sporting events, academic competitions, musical performances, and chess matches, among other school-sponsored activities. Although we recognize the value of playing on outside teams or participating in time-intensive activities outside of school, absence of a prearranged agreement as described below under Planned Absences may result in further disciplinary action and academic consequences, as appropriate. 
 
Planned Absences
For any absences that are planned ahead, whether for a family event, a college visit trip, a non-Portledge competition, or another unavoidable reason, a completed planned absence form found on myPortledge must be shared with the Upper School Office at least two days prior to the absence.  

If a student is absent from a class (or multiple classes on the same day) with no reason given by their parents/guardians in advance of the absences, the student will fall into the category of absent-cut. Students who have cut class will likely serve a detention for every unexcused absence, and other consequences will also be considered as appropriate. 

A family should not extend its own vacation beyond the scheduled school vacation periods (see a list of these dates below). Portledge does not consider this a valid reason for missing school and will not accept responsibility for helping students make up work missed because of such absences. The days immediately leading up to scheduled vacation periods are often very important: teachers try to bring lesson units to logical conclusions so that students may leave for vacation with a sense of completion. Likewise, new topics are often introduced immediately after vacations. Extended family vacations and during-the-school-day appointments (outside of those for illness) are considered to be unexcused. Students will have to make up any missed tests or quizzes and hand in any missed assignments the day before such absences (if the school is notified in advance). Students in such cases who do not hand in work ahead of the absence or according to an individual arrangement with a given teacher risk significant academic consequences, and Portledge will not accept responsibility for arranging makeups or other accommodations for them upon return to school. 

Students may not have more than two major in-class assessments (ones that take more than 50% of a given class period) on any given class day. All dates for major assessments are to be posted online in myPortledge, so students know in advance when they are having such assessments. Students must inform their teachers at least two days in advance if they will not be able to sit for such an assessment. If a teacher was not informed in advance and a student misses a major assessment, with the exception of appropriately excused absences as noted above, the student may not  be able to make up for the missed work. Without this notification, makeup privileges can be denied at the instructor‚Äôs discretion, and the student may be given a zero for the assessment. If issues arise around this set of guidelines, students should consult with their Dean, and the Division Director makes the final decision regarding these guidelines‚Äô application in individual exceptional circumstances.

Students who have submitted a doctor‚Äôs note because of illness or who have had an absence approved in advance by the school are entitled to extra help time in order to prepare for any assessments they may have missed, but they are responsible for scheduling that time directly with the teacher or teachers involved. In most cases, students will be expected to make up the work in a timely fashion. For example, if a student missed two days of school, the student will have no more than 2 days to make up work.

Mandatory Attendance
School trips are considered mandatory. Parents are not to ask that a child be excused. All families are charged for mandatory school trips, even if their children are not able to attend a particular trip. Please notify the Division Director if there are financial hardships caused by the trip.  A maximum of one field trip per semester per course will occur for 9th and 10th grade classes. A maximum of one field trip per school year per course will occur for 11th and 12th grade classes. No field trips will be scheduled for dates after spring break.

Mandatory Attendance Days for included groups include:

School trip days
Special Program Days
e.g., Community Service, Junior Leadership, Senior Launch, Senior Exhibition, Awards Ceremony, etc.
Blue White Day
Graduation


Students may seek approval for absences for religious or cultural observances not listed above as needed. For any student who is absent from school due to illness on any Mandatory Attendance Day and fails to provide appropriate documentation of family or medical situations that required the absence(s), there may be academic and/or disciplinary consequences.  

Seniors are expected to be present for all classes until Blue White Day.  

All 9th, 10th, and 11th grade students are expected to be present for school through June 10th. 

Permission to Leave School 
Because of the value placed upon participation in academic and extracurricular programs at school, students are generally not permitted to leave campus during the school day and/or until all after-school obligations are completed. We especially look to seniors to exercise an on-campus leadership role during their unscheduled periods. 


Free Period Attendance
Students are expected to be in school during their free periods, using the time for studying, meetings, extracurricular activities, or socialization within the Portledge community.
Community Time
Community Time is scheduled each day. Options will vary and include Clubs, Conference, Class Meetings, and Town Meeting. Student attendance is required and they are expected to participate as fully as possible.


In Case of Emergency or Sudden Sickness
The student must report to a member of the Upper School Office or their Dean, who will then notify the school nurse. The nurse, if necessary, will call home and make arrangements for pick-up. After being given permission, the student must sign out upon departure.   Parents should await contact from the school nurse before arranging pickup.	 


Senior Student Off-Campus and Driving Privileges
At the discretion of the Director of Upper School, Seniors may be given off-campus privileges. If and when such privileges are granted, Seniors may leave school a maximum of once per day by signing out in the Upper School office at the time of departure and signing in at the time of return. While Seniors are permitted to leave campus during free academic periods, Portledge community time, advisory and town meetings are not considered free periods and students are not permitted to leave campus during these times. Seniors may bring food back to campus for themselves to be eaten only in the Senior Lounge in Commons. The off-campus privilege may be exercised only by Seniors who have submitted a parental consent form to the office and are not on Academic or Disciplinary Warning. Seniors who drive must have passed the Student Driving Quiz. Seniors who arrive at school late to their first obligation of the day lose their off-campus privileges for that day. Seniors may only take passengers who are Seniors with written parental permission to ride with student drivers on file in the Upper School office. The Head of School, Assistant Head of School, Division Director, and the student‚Äôs parents/guardians all have the right to rescind aSenior‚Äôs off-campus privileges. Off-campus privileges may be revoked in response to cut classes, repeated lateness to school, failure to follow through properly on the college application process, failure to complete yearbook pages on time, missed Senior Project deadlines, or an excess of infractions accrued during a semester.


9th, 10th, and 11th Grade Students
All 9th, 10th, and 11th grade students are expected to be in attendance at school from the start of their on-campus daily obligations to 3:30 p.m. unless there is an unavoidable special circumstance, such as a medical emergency.

Guests at School 
A student who wishes to bring a friend to Portledge should check with the Division Director to receive permission the day before the visit. On the day of the visit, students must be sure their guests adhere to the letter and spirit of Portledge standards of dress and behavior. Guests should be introduced to the Division Director, as well as to each classroom teacher whose classes they attend. 
 
Upper School Academics
Courses of Study
9th and 10th grade schedules comprise primarily required courses. Electives are available to all students, with the variety of options increasing as students progress through their four-year programs. Detailed descriptions of all courses can be found in the Upper School Course Descriptions. Typical course loads are as follows, though significant variation is possible in particular circumstances:

9th Grade
English; algebra I or geometry; biology; French, Spanish, or Mandarin; European history; physical education; electives in music, theatre, technology, visual arts, and other areas
10th Grade
English; geometry or algebra II; chemistry; modern European history; French, Spanish, or Mandarin; health; physical education; electives in music, theatre, technology, visual arts, and other areas
11th Grade
English; algebra II or pre-calculus; physics; American history; French, Spanish, or Mandarin; physical education; electives in music, theatre, technology, visual arts, and other areas
IB Diploma candidates are assigned specific required courses
12th Grade
English; calculus, pre-calculus, or applied mathematics; physical education; other required core classes; electives in music, theatre, technology, visual arts, and other areas
IB Diploma candidates are assigned specific required courses

 
Students request their courses for the following school year during the second semester of the previous school year. All course selections must be approved by the student‚Äôs dean and parent(s)/guardian(s. Students entering 9th grade liaise with various members of the Dean Team, the Upper School Office, and the Admissions Office to ensure appropriate placements wherever possible.
 
Every effort is made to enroll students in their first-choice classes. However, if a family has not submitted an enrollment contract and deposit in time, their child will not be included in the initial scheduling process. The result may be that a particular elective or section may no longer be available by the time any enrollment issues are resolved. Moreover, even on-time and appropriate course requests are subject to various idiosyncrasies in the process. Whenever students are not placed in their first-choice core classes and/or electives, communication occurs with the students and relevant members of their support systems so as to ensure that their voices are heard in the scheduling process and that the right items are prioritized in making the necessary decisions in that process.

Note Concerning Placement in Mathematics
The traditional math sequence for Portledge students follows:

While some students enter 9th grade enrolled in Algebra 1, most Upper School students enter 9th grade having completed Algebra 1, enabling them to enroll in Geometry as 9th graders. Some other students enter 9th grade having completed Geometry, enabling them to begin 9th grade in Algebra 2.

Students seeking to ‚Äòmove ahead‚Äô in the mathematics sequence at any juncture of their academic career are permitted to do so through the completion of an approved summer plan. For example, rising 9th graders may wish to complete Algebra 1 in the summer prior to 9th grade in order to enter 9th grade in Geometry, or a rising 11th grader may wish to complete Algebra 2 in the summer in order to enroll in the IB Diploma programme.

Portledge offers summer courses in order to help students and families ensure that they have the content and skills necessary to successfully move ahead the following year. Students who enroll in Portledge summer math courses and attain a passing grade will have such courses noted as part of their Portledge transcript and will be able to advance in the curriculum at the beginning of the next school year.

Students unable or unwilling to take summer courses at Portledge must have summer plans pre-approved by the chairperson of the mathematics department and pass a placement test in order to move ahead in the mathematics curriculum.

Electing Advanced Courses  
We encourage students to set the achievement bar high and to push their academic boundaries at whatever level is most appropriate for them. Seeking challenge is important, but ensuring student success is paramount. 

If a student elects a course that may be a stretch academically, the Dean, Advisor, Teacher, and other relevant community members will counsel the student to carefully reflect upon the decision. If a student or family feels strongly that a student should take a course more rigorous than the one for which they have been recommended, each department has a formal recommendation appeal process that must be followed in order to challenge the recommendation. For current Portledge students, all appeals must be initiated by the student by April 17, 2026 in order to be considered.

If a student wishes to enroll in an English course for which they have not been recommended, they must complete the following steps:
Submit two graded English essays to the English Department chairperson for review.  These essays should be accurate and representative examples of a student‚Äôs written and analytical skills. 
Complete a timed written assessment administered by the English Department.  It will measure the student‚Äôs knowledge of literary devices, annotation skills, and close-reading abilities.

If a student wishes to enroll in a History course for which they have not been recommended, they must complete the following steps:
Students must first speak to the teacher of recommendation.
Students must speak to the department head.
Students must complete a placement test.

If a student wishes to enroll in a Science course for which they have not been recommended, they must complete the following steps:
Obtain approval from the Department Chair.
Students wishing to take AP Chemistry in grades 9 or 10 must additionally take a placement exam administered at Portledge.
If a student wishes to enroll in a Mathematics course for which they have not been recommended, they must complete the following steps:
Successfully complete a placement test. 
Gain approval of the Department Chair.

If a student wishes to enroll in a Language course for which they have not been recommended, they must complete the following steps:
Contact the teacher who made the recommendation and the department chairperson for approval.
Take a placement exam to determine the appropriate course selection.

We have a window at the start of the school year that allows students to change their minds without repercussions if a course is not a good fit.

This academic year, Portledge Upper School students have until Fri., Oct. 10, 2025, to drop or switch sections for a full-year or 1st semester class and Fri., Feb. 6, 2026 for a 2nd semester class. Core courses cannot be dropped; they must be replaced with an equivalent that meets graduation requirements. All teachers in core courses will have a set of representative assessments completed and graded by the drop date to give students enough information to make informed decisions. No exceptions will be made to the October 10th  and February 6th deadlines for Upper School students.

If a student feels the need to drop a course after the drop date, it will remain on the transcript with the letter W, indicating the student withdrew from the course. The term grade that was in place at the time of the change will carry over into the new course and be averaged into the final mark for the semester. The degree to which grades will be carried over and reflected in overall grades will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the new course teacher, subject to review by the Director of Upper School.

Students who are considering dropping a class should consult with a dean and/or an advisor as early as possible to discuss the available options. In most cases, students can drop from an advanced class to a regular section, but not always. Portledge is a small school, and as such, the schedule cannot accommodate every student request. We do take time to discuss with every student the reasoning behind their request in every case. Course selection requires careful monitoring and attention; we encourage students to be proactive with their dean and their advisor regarding these issues.

Advanced Placement (AP) and the International Baccalaureate Programme (IB)
Junior and senior year offer the opportunity for accelerated and advanced learning through two unique programs: Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB). Advanced Placement courses are offered in a variety of subjects across disciplines (refer to course descriptions). These courses give students the opportunity to master a large body of content in a particular area, such as Calculus or Chemistry. The course culminates in a standardized test administered worldwide in May. The exams are then sent to the College Board for independent scoring. Students receive the results of their tests during summer. Students may also elect to pursue independent study in a particular Advanced Placement area and sit for the examination in May. More information regarding Advanced Placement testing is made initially available by the Testing Coordinator in Fall of each school year.

IB offers similar opportunities for students but with a significant difference: students may elect to earn the IB Diploma by enrolling in the full two-year program, taking 6 core classes through the IB program. IB classes also differ from AP in their approaches to learning. Whereas AP demands mastery of a large amount of content, the rigor in IB comes from a high level of critical engagement. Students in IB are tested through a combination of assessments that are scored by their teachers as well as by independent graders internationally. Those assessments begin in May of junior year and often culminate in May of senior year. Students who are interested in pursuing the IB Diploma meet with the IB Coordinator in the second semester of sophomore year, although these meetings can take place earlier if so desired.

Detailed information about both programs is available from the college counselors, deans, the Testing Coordinator, and the IB Coordinator. Those students interested in the IB diploma program should meet with the IB Coordinator early in the second semester of their sophomore year.

Special Fees
In certain courses, additional fees may be charged if a student wishes to do a special project that requires materials beyond the scope of the course. Likewise, there may be fees assessed for certain athletic programs (e.g., ice hockey, squash, golf) or special programs. Fees may be charged to help underwrite certain field trips or materials used in elective courses. In the case of mandatory field trips, all families are charged, even if a child is unable to attend. Fees are also billed for various standardized tests.  

Important Note 
In the event of a national or local emergency that forces the school to close or make alternate plans to operate, tuition will not be refunded and will remain due in full, unless otherwise indicated by the School.

Graduation Requirements
The Portledge diploma indicates that a student has met the college preparatory standards of Portledge School and the requirements of the State of New York. These standards are divided into a few areas: 
quantity and distribution of credits
physical education
community service
completion of a senior project
acceptance into a 4-year college 


Seniors who do not meet all graduation requirements will not be granted a Portledge diploma. Normally, this must be accomplished by completing additional work during the summer.

Each diploma is considered a one-of-a-kind legal document and will not be replaced if lost or damaged.

Quantity and Distribution of Credits
Students must successfully complete a minimum of 18 academic credits during the Upper School years to earn a Portledge diploma. Most Portledge graduates earn far in excess of the 18 required academic credits. Students are expected to take a minimum of 5 for-credit courses each semester and to earn a total of 5 credits each year. Each semester, any course loads of  less than 5 for-credit courses must be approved by the Upper School Division Director. English and mathematics must be taken each semester. 

The credit and course requirements to be earned during Upper School are as follows:
4 credits in English
4 credits in Mathematics
3 credits in Lab Sciences
3 credits in History
2 credits during high school years in French, Mandarin or Spanish, culminating in at least level 3
A required non-credit course in Health
For students in grades 10, 11, and 12:
At least two courses from among the Visual Arts, the Performing Arts, and Computer Science
For students in grade 9:
At least one course in the Performing Arts
At least one course from among the Visual Arts and Computer Science


Academic Standing and Academic Warning
To progress to the next grade, and to be considered for a Portledge diploma, a student must earn no fewer than five credits each year and have no failures in required courses. At the end of each quarter, any student with two or more D‚Äôs, three or more C-range grades, or a failing grade in any course is considered for placement on Academic Warning.

End-of-year failures in courses required for graduation must be rectified through outside summer credit approved by the Upper School Director  or (if the School so recommends) by the repetition of the course in a subsequent year. In certain cases, summer work may be required even if a student earned a grade of C or D in a course to provide needed preparation for the next level of difficulty in that subject, or for a student to remain in an Advanced section (e.g., in languages or mathematics). In such cases, if summer work is not sufficiently completed, the student may be forced to retake the course. End-of-year failures in elective courses not required for graduation may be addressed through summer work at the discretion of the Director of Upper School.

The Director of Upper School must approve all summer work. Required summer work must be successfully completed in order for a student to return to Portledge in the fall. Re-enrollment contracts are activated upon completion of summer work.

Physical Education Requirement
The State of New York requires that each Upper School student participate in physical education during the school year. Students may choose between interscholastic sports and Physical Education class on a season-to-season basis. Students are also able to apply for exemptions to the Physical Education requirement on a season-to-season basis based on their participation in external athletic endeavors. Exemption requests must be submitted to the Director of Athletics. The physical education requirement must be met in order for a student to graduate.

Community Partnership Experience (CPE)
The Community Partnership Experience requires all students in 9th‚Äì12th grades to participate in one experiential service trip and reflect on their experience. Reflections will highlight the impact of academics on each experience, as well as how the experience impacts academics and day-to-day life. Purpose is key, and students can use these experiences to guide the theme of their Senior Project, which takes place in their final year of Portledge.

At Portledge, students are provided with an amazing opportunity to combine purposeful community service with their academic curriculum. Our goal is to have our students meaningfully support the community while building character and promoting a strong connection between academic studies and real-life experience. Students will be able to explore their community, create purpose and direction within their experiences, and ultimately excel in the skills required for success.  

As part of the Portledge School CPE Requirement, students are expected to attend the service trip organized by Portledge School and travel with Portledge to and from their assigned trip location via transportation provided by the school. This school year, 9th graders will be traveling on Wed., Oct. 8, 2025.  The 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-grades will be traveling on Wed., Mar. 11, 2026. Look out for an updated Parent/Student Contract and any required Permission Slips in the Forms tab in myPortledge. Please be aware of the strict deadlines we must adhere to on behalf of our partner organizations. As such, keep an eye out for any emails about the CPE trips.

Upon completion of the service trip, students will be expected to complete and turn in a Reflection Form that will be handed out by the trip chaperones before returning to campus. At the end of the school year, student report cards will indicate whether or not students have met this requirement via a Pass/Fail notation. Students will receive a ‚ÄúP‚Äù indicating that they did meet the requirement, or an ‚ÄúF‚Äù indicating that they did not meet the requirement or make it up.

Students are welcome and encouraged to exceed the service requirement and may do so at organizations that meet Portledge‚Äôs CPE expectations. Exceeded hours may be completed either during the school year or over the summer preceding it. To ensure hours are eligible for approval or to discuss potential service opportunities, students are encouraged to meet with the CPE Coordinator and/or carefully review the Portledge expectations. 

Upon completion of service, students must thoroughly complete the Reflection Form, including having it signed by a parent and a representative of the service organization. Once submitted to the CPE Coordinator, the form and the experience will be reviewed. If the experience is approved, the hours will be logged and the student will receive a confirmation notification. Please note: the additional service notation will only be awarded once the Portledge Trip Requirement has been fulfilled. The Reflection Form can be found on the Resources Tab on myPortledge on the Community Partnership Experience Resource Board. See the CPE expectations below. 

All forms must be submitted and approved by Tue., May 5, 2026, to earn the additional service notation.

*A personal, signed letter that includes contact information may take the place of the Point Person signature.*

To be approved, CPE hours must: 
Involve direct, hands-on service with the population or cause being supported (individuals, animals, environment, etc.).
Address a public need and serve others meaningfully.
Encourage students to learn something new and grow from the experience.
Be intentional and purposeful. 
Be completed through authorized, approved organizations that are open to all students, with no financial exchange involved.

Hours will not be approved for:
Paid work, internships, or volunteer roles that require payment to participate (such as certain camp counselor positions).
Activities completed in previous school years.
Volunteering efforts without direct involvement.
Donation-based efforts without direct involvement (from planning to execution).

While some fee-based or paid experiences may be valuable, Portledge prioritizes service opportunities that are equitable and accessible to all students, regardless of financial resources. This ensures that every student can participate in meaningful, hands-on service experiences. 

All CPE information can be found on the Resources tab in myPortledge on the Community Partnership Experience Resource Board. 

Senior Projects
It is a long-standing tradition at Portledge for each senior to focus on a substantive, well-developed and productive project throughout the academic year.

The goal of the project is to explore an area of interest and to accomplish something that matters. The opportunity allows students to investigate a problem, explore a belief, confront a challenge, or even take a risk. This journey requires effort, focused attention, and dedication. Throughout the year Seniors work diligently on projects that require them to be creative, that focus on activity and personal or others‚Äô well-being, and/or that involve serving others within the community. The nature of the project varies, depending upon student interests. For example, IB diploma candidates focus on their culminating CAS project. 

The deadlines and details associated with the senior project are disseminated and managed primarily by the Senior Project Coordinator. Projects are graded pass/fail, and exemplary projects are awarded certificates of distinction. A Senior‚Äôs privileges will be revoked and eligibility for Senior Project Awards will be jeopardized if Senior Project deadlines are not met.

Senior End-of-Year Attendance
The last day of senior classes is Blue White Day, Fri., May 22, 2026. Seniors are expected to attend all of their classes, including IB and AP classes, until the end of the school day on May 21, after which they will be working on their Senior Projects until Mon., Jun. 8, 2026, at which point they will rehearse their Projects in preparation for their presentations on Tue., Jun. 9, 2026. Other school obligations, such as sports, however, must still be met until their culmination.

Tests and Examinations
It is expected that students will not miss scheduled tests. If a student is going to be late or is sick on a test day, a parent must notify the Upper School Office first thing in the morning. Without this notification, makeup privileges can be denied at the instructor‚Äôs discretion, and the student may be given a zero for the assessment. For particularly egregious instances, the administration reserves the right to determine academic consequences, potentially overruling or disregarding the instructor's chosen consequences. If a major paper is due on the day of an absence, it must be emailed or uploaded to the teacher (and a hard copy submitted upon return to school if so desired by the teacher). Students who arrive at school late for a scheduled test must contact  that teacher on the same day to arrange a make-up exam. Athletes who know of conflicts caused by early dismissal for games must notify the teacher at least a day in advance. The teacher may ask the athlete to take the test earlier in the day. Tests belong to the individual teachers, who will inform their students about their test-return policies.

Teachers make a great effort to avoid scheduling more than two major tests or papers on the same day for any one student; however, conflicts occasionally occur. These are best resolved by the student‚Äôs bringing the conflict to the attention of the teachers involved.
 
Students are informed about the relative weight of all examinations, as determined by the individual departments. Each instructor will be required to post their syllabus on myPortledge, which must include the grading criteria for the class. Any change to this criteria must be clearly communicated to the class and the syllabus amended to reflect such changes.

Separate schedules for cumulative exams are issued in advance of the examination period. It is expected that students will not be absent from any scheduled examination. The sniffles, a headache, or staying up too late studying are not acceptable excuses for missing an examination. If, however, an illness precludes a student‚Äôs attendance at an examination, their parent/guardian must call the school by 8:15 a.m.; upon return, the student should provide a member of the Upper School Office a physician‚Äôs excuse for the absence and be prepared to take a makeup examination on the specified day. 

The comprehensive final examination given in all core academic courses at the end of the year helps a student to put the whole year‚Äôs work into perspective while simultaneously permitting the teacher to assess the student‚Äôs overall grasp of the course work. Further, preparing for exams in Upper School serves as important training for cumulative collegiate exams. With exceptions for students assessed externally in AP or IB courses, there are no exemptions from final exams. During AP and/or IB weeks, AP and IB students must attend all of their regularly-scheduled classes except on any day they have an AP or IB exam; on those days, they may depart school at the completion of their  exams. They may also arrive late and miss morning classes if their examinations begin in the afternoon. AP and IB courses will continue to meet after their AP or IB exams. Any student enrolled in an AP or IB class will have the opportunity to sit for the AP or IB exam; however, they will not be strictly required to do so. However, all AP or IB students will be required to remain in class until the end of their courses‚Äô scheduled meetings. Additionally, students in AP or IB classes who choose NOT to take external assessments must take Portledge final exams. Seniors in this position will test on May 15, 18, 19, and 20. Seniors‚Äô last full week of classes this year will be May 18 to May 21. All Senior Finals should occur in class on May 15, 18, 19, and 20. Senior Launch will take place on May 21, and Blue White Day on May 22. Any IB Diploma candidate must sit for all IB assessments.  Any student enrolled in an IB class who wishes the IB designation must sit for all assessments. Classes with seniors and underclassmen in them will administer one final exam to seniors on May 15, 18, 19, and/or 20 and a second one to underclassmen during final examination week.  

Exam Protocols
Backpacks, Cell Phones, and Electronic Devices:
On exam days, students  are to leave all book bags, textbooks, notebooks, notes, etc. either in their lockers or in the front of the room in their book bags (piled neatly).  
Cell phones are not permitted. They must be put in students‚Äô lockers, left in backpacks, or stored in classroom sleeves.  
If a student has a cell phone or other electronic device despite our local prohibition, it will be stored by the proctor.
Devices will not be returned  to anyone until all test materials have been collected from the entire group.

Grading Policy 
The assessment of student work and the assignment of grades is a responsibility entrusted to the Portledge School faculty. Faculty members endeavor to be fair and consistent in their assessment of student work and to provide students with sufficient opportunities to demonstrate learning and progress. Parents/guardians are welcome to discuss student learning and progress with teachers, but conversations about grades (in the Upper and Middle School) should take place between students and their teachers. Should a question or concern remain unresolved, parents/guardians may then consult with the teacher and, if they still have questions, the appropriate Department Head. Parents/guardians should understand, however, that in all cases, the teacher retains the sole right to assign grades to the teacher‚Äôs students. Under no circumstances should students or parents/guardians endeavor to have a grade changed. Each instructor‚Äôs syllabus and grading methodology will be clearly posted on or before the first day of classes on the Bulletin Board page of their particular class in Blackbaud.

When a teacher anticipates assigning a failing semester grade, the teacher apprises the student‚Äôs parents/guardians and advisor of the student‚Äôs academic difficulty prior to the end of the semester. This communication takes the form of an infraction, email, phone call, or in-person conversation with the above parties at a time when the student still has the opportunity to improve the student‚Äôs standing for the semester. Reports are sent home at the end of each semester. These reports include an academic achievement grade and a numerical effort grade for each subject (see chart below). A first quarter grade report including written comments about a student‚Äôs progress and anticipated marks is sent in early November for all students for all full-year and one-semester classes taking place in the first semester of the school year. A third quarter grade report will be published in Mid-March, also containing anticipated marks; for all one-semester classes taking place in the second semester, this grade report will contain written comments. Teachers of pass/fail classes may offer comments at any point at their own discretion but are not required to do so. Teachers may offer comment on first-semester report cards, third quarter grade reports, and final report cards at their discretion. They will always do so for students whose anticipated or actual grades fall below C+. All students will receive full advisor comments on final report cards. 
Note: The School may withhold reports if financial obligations are in arrears.

Policy concerning 8th Grade Students Taking Upper School Courses
For Students Enrolled in Portledge Middle School:
Students who are enrolled in 8th grade at Portledge School and are taking Upper School courses (defined as classes that appear in the Upper School Course Descriptions) at Portledge School will have those courses appear on their official Portledge Upper School transcript. 
Furthermore, the grades earned in these courses will count toward their Portledge Upper School Grade Point Average (GPA) and toward the minimum credit accrual requirements in the relevant subject areas with respect to graduation. 
Families wishing to reverse course once equivalency has been granted must present such requests in writing to the Director of Upper School.
Portledge 8th grade students involved in Portledge Upper School classes will have their performance and progress formally reviewed prior to the conclusion of the Upper School add/drop period, which normally occurs sometime during the first two weeks of October. 
If a student is identified as likely to struggle with respect to performance and progress over the rest of the school year, the student and family will be contacted in order to decide whether to maintain enrollment in their Upper School class(es) or make changes to their schedule to better meet their needs.
For Students Enrolled in Middle Schools Other Than Portledge Middle School
For students who have taken high school courses while enrolled in 8th grade at a Middle School other than Portledge Middle School, the following stipulations apply:
General Practice
As a general policy, Portledge School does not consider such courses as equivalent to Portledge Upper School courses. 
Additionally, high school courses taken outside of Portledge (whether in middle or high school) are reflected on that school‚Äôs transcript, and therefore are not included on the Portledge transcript or factored into the Portledge GPA. 
That transcript will then be sent alongside the Portledge transcript for college admissions purposes, as well as any other request for official transcripts. 
However, depending on the specific course and subject area, these courses may be considered during the Admissions and Scheduling processes to determine appropriate course placement upon entry to Portledge Upper School and progression through subject area curricula. 
Hence, for example, a student who took Geometry at another Middle School while in 8th grade and performed reasonably well would likely be enrolled in Algebra 2 at the college preparatory or advanced level if they were to enter Portledge at the 9th grade level. 
However, that Geometry class would not appear on the Portledge Upper School Transcript, nor would the grade be included in the calculation of the Upper School GPA or count toward the minimum credit accrual requirements in the relevant subject areas with respect to graduation. 
The same would hold true in other examples, such as a high school world language class taken during 8th grade, a Living Environment class taken during 8th grade, etc. 
Case-by-Case Evaluation for High School Equivalency
If families new to Portledge Upper School believe that a course taken by a student in 8th grade at another institution should be considered the equivalent of a Portledge Upper School course, and that the course should therefore be managed as external high school courses are for transfer students, they should raise this matter during the Admissions and/or Scheduling processes. 
Such instances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the relevant individuals at Portledge School. 
New to Portledge families interested in an equivalency evaluation should be aware that more information may be required of them than what is part of the general Admissions and Scheduling processes in order to effectively evaluate the validity of the request. 
This determination will be made at the sole discretion of Portledge School as a result of an evaluation that will take into consideration the status of the institution at which the course(s) in question occurred and that of the teacher(s) of the course(s), among other factors.
The aforementioned review of such requests may involve any or all of the following individuals:
The Director of Upper School
The Assistant Director of Upper School
The Upper School Deans
Department Chairpersons
The College Counseling Team
Any courses deemed equivalent through the above review process will count toward the minimum credit accrual requirements in the relevant subject areas with respect to graduation. 
In such cases, an official transcript from the sending school must be sent to the Portledge Registrar. That transcript will then be sent alongside the Portledge transcript for college admissions purposes and in response to any other request for official transcripts. 
These courses will not appear on the Portledge transcript. 
Please note that for NCAA eligibility purposes, all transcripts must be submitted directly from the individual institution. 
In other words the NCAA will only accept the Portledge transcript from Portledge School and all outside institutions must submit their own transcripts directly to the Eligibility Center for the student to be considered eligible for Division 1 or Division 2 athletics.
Appeals of decisions that do not grant equivalency should be presented in writing by families to the Head of School no more than ten business days following notification of the initial decision by a member of the above committee or a member of the Admissions Team.
Decisions to grant equivalency are generally considered final. 
However, families wishing to reverse course once equivalency has been granted must present such requests in writing to the Director of Upper School.

Academic Grades

Grade
Range of Score
Quality of Performance
A
93-100


Exemplary performance in all areas of the course. The student has shown a strong grasp of fundamental facts and concepts as well as insight into many nuances of the material. Thoroughness of understanding is most evident. (Portledge does not award A+ as a grade.)
A-
90-92
B+
88-89
Above average work. There is a solid grasp of fundamental facts and concepts with a demonstrated ability to apply them critically.
B
83-87
B-
80-82
C+
78-79
Average work. The student is meeting expectations adequately and has a reasonably firm grasp of fundamental concepts and facts.
C
73-77
C-
70-72
D
65-69
Below average work. The minimal requirements of the course are being barely met. (Portledge does not give grades of D+ or D-.)
F
Below 65
Failing work. Grasp of course material is not sufficient for credit.
I
Work Incomplete
Under unusual circumstances (e.g., prolonged illness), a student may receive an Incomplete at the end of a semester, as not all work has yet been completed and there is reason not to hold the student academically accountable at the moment. The student must correct this situation within a specified time after the end of the semester, or a failing grade could result.

Effort Grades


Grade
Interpretation
1
Outstanding effort. The student shows consistent devotion to meeting and often exceeding the expectations of the course.
2
Good effort. The student meets general classroom requirements, and often demonstrates academic initiative.
3
Uneven effort. The student sometimes neglects academic responsibilities. Motivation occurs in fits and starts.
4
Poor effort. The student is generally indifferent about meeting academic expectations.

 
Transcript
The transcript records pertinent Portledge School academic information about the student. It lists final grades earned by the student during the Upper School years at Portledge. It also includes notes concerning required or exceptional Community Service achievements by students and students‚Äô cumulative GPA. External online courses are not factored into GPA. Transcripts of such courses are sent directly from the online provider. The transcript normally does not include summer elective academic courses taken at a college or a university unless summer work was mandated by the school to rectify (but not replace) a subpar final grade.  Courses dropped after the designated drop-add date will remain on the transcript with a notation of WP (Withdrew Passing) or WF (Withdrew Failing) with no grade or credit given for the dropped course. The transcript is automatically sent to all colleges and universities (or, where applicable, boarding or secondary schools) to which a student is applying. A transcript is not released under any circumstances if a family has not met its financial obligations to the School. 

Requests for transcripts must be submitted to the Registrar via email or paper, giving the exact address of the institution to which transcripts should be mailed. Such requests will be honored within five (5) business days of receipt whenever possible.

High Honor Roll and Honor Roll
In the Upper School, recognition for outstanding academic achievement is computed at the end of the school year, based on final grades.  A student is placed on the High Honor Roll by earning all grades of A or A-. A student is placed on the Honor Roll by receiving all grades of straight B or better. 

Policy on Ranking and GPA
As is the case in many selective independent schools, individual class rank is not considered a significant measure of a student‚Äôs academic achievement and is not computed. Portledge, however, does send each college a copy of our annually updated Portledge School Profile, which includes pertinent information about Portledge School, including its graduation requirements and statistical information about the distribution of grades for its senior class. Further, because many colleges and universities (especially large state institutions) ask for, or require, a computed GPA, Portledge computes an unweighted GPA at the end of each Upper School grade based on courses completed at Portledge.

Cum Laude Society
In 1990, the Cum Laude Society installed the Portledge Chapter of student, alumni, and faculty members. Modeled after Phi Beta Kappa, the Cum Laude Society has the objective ‚Äúto promote learning and sound scholarship in secondary schools.‚Äù Each year, the chapter may elect additional members from the junior or senior classes who have demonstrated intellectualism and academic excellence in a college preparatory curriculum. In addition to academic excellence, inductees must have demonstrated qualities of good character, honor, and integrity in all aspects of school life. 

Shortly after the completion of the first semester, the on-campus members of the chapter review the accomplishments of potential inductees by scrutinizing their record of academic achievement, standardized test scores (where applicable), and general scholastic and behavioral deportment. Student membership in Cum Laude may not exceed 20% of the senior class.  Up to half of that number (not more than 10%) is eligible for early induction at the end of junior year.  Students may also be inducted at the end of senior year.

Students who will complete 9th, 10th, and 11th grade at Portledge are eligible for early induction at the end of their junior year or induction at the end of their senior year.

Students who will complete 10th, 11th, and 12th grade at Portledge are eligible for induction at the end of their senior year.  

Per Portledge‚Äôs chapter bylaws, students who enroll during the 11th or 12th grade are typically not considered for induction because they have not completed the majority of their secondary school career at Portledge.  However, in rare cases, the chapter may consider such candidates if they are deemed truly exceptional in their scholarship and character.  Such students would be inducted at the end of their senior year.

Arts Scholars
During the Upper School years, certain students elect to take a comprehensive program in the visual or performing arts. Students who demonstrate exemplary work with sustained high achievement in the prescribed program and who have petitioned (and have been approved by) the Arts Departments may earn the designation of Arts Scholar upon graduation and are so recognized at Graduation.  Details and criteria are available on the Resource Board and in the Course Descriptions Catalog.

STEAM Scholar
The STEAM Scholar Program is a planned, multi-year program of study in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math; it is open to students in 10th‚Äì12th grade. A student wishing to become a STEAM Scholar may be nominated by a member of the STEAM Review Board or complete an application, available on the Resource Board; from any science, math, art or technology teacher; and in the Course Description Catalog. The application outlines the requirements and should be discussed with a dean, an advisor, and a department chair.

Portledge Language Honor Society
In 2023, Portledge established Chinese, French, and Spanish chapters through the World Languages and Cultures Department, culminating in the conception of the Portledge Language Honor Society. Inducted students demonstrate their love and appreciation for learning about languages and cultures. The Portledge Language Honor Society emphasizes community service and leadership, which are vital to being a true global citizen. Inductees in the Portledge Language Honor Society must have maintained academic excellence in their language of instruction (A average) and overall academic commitment to their studies in all core areas (A- overall); have studied at least two years of language at Portledge and be enrolled in a level 3 language class or higher; have demonstrated the Portledge pillars of Kindness, Honor, Purpose, and Respect; and must be of strong moral character. 

To be accepted into the Portledge Language Honor Society, students will fill out an application, solicit two teacher recommendations, and complete a written task in their language of study. The World Languages and Cultures Department will review all applications to ensure that students meet the requirements and are committed to serving the Portledge World Language Honor Society. 

Homework  
Homework can serve an essential function in the instructional process when assigned purposefully with the goal of expanding students‚Äô knowledge, skills, and critical thinking ability. Students should bear these goals in mind as they review and prepare each day.

The length of time a student takes to complete homework assignments varies from grade to grade and from individual to individual. In general, Upper Schoolers should spend 35-40 minutes per class on each homework assignment.  Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate students should expect 45-60 minutes of homework in each course. Teachers expect students to complete homework independent of another student‚Äôs aid or undue support from any others, including tutors and parents. Copying someone else‚Äôs homework (or allowing one‚Äôs own to be copied) constitutes a breach of academic honesty that may necessitate the convening of the Honor Council. Similarly, using corner-cutting aids such as Spark Notes instead of completing assigned reading or using online translators instead of completing foreign language work is considered a breach of academic integrity. 

The prime responsibility for completing assignments rests with the student, who is expected to budget their time wisely and not to procrastinate. Teachers want to know when a student has difficulty completing assignments in order to give individualized help with the learning process. In each course, assignments are given to students and posted on myPortledge, our on-line learning management system. In addition to nightly homework, longer-term projects may be assigned. The School expects all students to have and utilize word-processing skills. 

In recognition of the importance of mental health and maintaining a healthy life balance, student homework is not assigned in a way that necessitates that students complete such work on religious holidays or during extended breaks from school. Some students choose to use a vacation to do work on a long-term project like a term paper, but due dates for such items will not immediately follow extended breaks from school. All Upper School students are required to complete a summer reading assignment (posted on the Portledge website). 
 
Getting Assignments in on Time
The faculty expects that students will submit all assigned work on time. Work is marked late if a student (who has not been specifically excused because of legitimate absence or some other reason) does not hand in an assignment when a teacher calls for it. At the teacher‚Äôs discretion, unexcused late work may receive a zero.  If a student is absent on the day a paper is due, the teacher will decide whether the paper needs to be emailed or uploaded so that it arrives on time despite the absence. 


Extra Help 
Teachers make every reasonable effort to give students extra help as needed, provided the student has been demonstrating positive efforts and attitudes. This help is provided during scheduled conference time. While students and teachers are free to arrange other help sessions outside of these times, it is the school‚Äôs expectation that such arrangements are to be made if and only if full and effective usage of scheduled conference times is already occurring. It is the responsibility of the student to appropriately prioritize their course help needs and address them with their teachers during conference times. A dean or advisor may be a helpful resource with respect to helping guide thinking with respect to such prioritization. Students should seek extra help in advance of a due date or major assessment, at the first sign of confusion, or immediately following a poor performance. If a student has a specific learning issue that requires tutoring on a regular basis, or if the tutoring is necessary as the result of an extended absence, the school may be able to provide the names of some tutors. The tutor‚Äôs fees are the responsibility of the family. The family should ask that the tutor contact the student‚Äôs dean so that we may provide guidance about areas that need attention. If a tutor is necessary, it is essential that they be in contact with the dean or the teachers whose courses are of most concern. A tutor should not be viewed by the student as a reason to pay less attention in class.  An effective tutor is one who quickly trains a student how to become a more effective learner both during and after class.

Program Leadership Committee
This standing committee of the faculty is empowered to hear requests for academic programs that are new suggestions or are different from the norm. Students should consult their Dean, their Advisor and the Division Director about developing independent studies. 

Gilmour Library 
The Gilmour Library Media Center provides students with an ever-growing collection of physical and digital resources that are available for student research and pleasure reading. Research is aided through the availability of an online catalog, subscription databases, and Wi-Fi access to the internet. The library also provides students access to e-Readers, Chromebooks and desktop workstations to complete school work.	

The library serves as a reading, research and collaborative study center. When using the library, students are expected to be respectful to other patrons and use the available computers responsibly. All students are free to use the library for academic work during lunch periods, before/after school, and during their unscheduled periods unless the space is being used for some other purpose or program (such as AP testing or a club event), which will be publicized in advance when this is the case. The library staff offers instruction to students on how to use the library‚Äôs resources, aids them with research, and provides reading guidance. Special programs within each grade‚Äôs curriculum utilize the library to help students learn in detail the methods of writing a major research paper.

Computer Use
Computers have become essential tools in the educational process. At the beginning of the year, students are given protocols concerning appropriate use of the facilities and machines. A copy of the computer-use policy can be found in an appendix of this document. In short, the desktop computers and lent Chromebooks are school property and are to be used responsibly in line with their educational purposes. Similarly, it is expected that students will use their laptops at school in an appropriate, academically-focused manner. Illegal downloading or use of pirated  software is prohibited.  Cyber bullying is, of course, prohibited.
Co-Curricular Activities
These opportunities enhance the school experience by offering our students opportunities for self-expression and growth in directions beyond the strictly academic.  US students participate in the Activities Program.  Activities are designed to include one or more of the following: 
service to, or involvement with, the community
the life-long pursuit of learning
artistic or intellectual growth
the development of a practical skill 


A variety of Activities (mostly year-long) are offered.  A sampling includes: community service, yearbook (Collage), literary magazine (Portledge Blossoms), Green Team, Mock Trial, Diversity Club, and various other groups. The list of available clubs and activities is made available each year following the annual Activities Fair in fall.


Advisory Mission Statement
The Portledge Upper School Advisory program provides a warm, inclusive community of Kindness, Honor, Purpose, and Respect that fosters each individual‚Äôs personal and emotional growth and well-being.

Faculty Advisor
Each summer, students who are new to Upper School are assigned a Faculty Advisor. The Advisor counsels the student in academic matters, social-emotional topics and character development while serving as a liaison between home and school. Advisors will contact the parents of each of their advisees early in the school year to inaugurate easy and open communication with the families. During the course of the year, either the Advisor or the parents may initiate additional contact. Absent a clear disconnect within the advisor-student relationship, each student will maintain the same advisor throughout their Upper School career. Alongside and in partnership with each student‚Äôs dean, advisors help ensure student success and fulfillment throughout the Upper School experience.

Upper School Deans
There are three Upper School Deans that act as guides and shepherds through students‚Äô Upper School journeys. The Deans‚Äô primary responsibilities are to know and support the students. While academic instructors focus on their individual discipline and developing student relationships in the classroom, the Deans focus on strengthening students‚Äô connections to the Portledge Pillars, developing their characters, advising them on their academic and curricular choices, and supporting their overall health and well-being. Each of the Deans specializes in a particular area of work at the school, but all work as a team to facilitate the smooth operation of the school‚Äôs culture.

Upper School Assistant Division Director
The Upper School Assistant Division Director assists the Upper School Division Director with all matters of curriculum, discipline, and student life at the Upper School and, at the discretion of the Upper School Division Director, may act in their stead.

Upper School Division Director
The Upper School Division Director is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day program in 9th‚Äì12th grades. Matters of curriculum, discipline and student life are under their aegis. 

Learning Needs
Portledge offers reasonable accommodations to those with documented needs. Our School Psychologist and Learning Specialist meet with individuals and/or families to coordinate and help those who require additional time in testing situations or other accommodations. Those with a Section 504 Accommodation Plans or IESP‚Äôs are afforded additional time as prescribed and approved by their plan. Classroom modifications and testing accommodations are only provided to students with a Section 504 Accommodation Plan or Individualized Educational Services Plan.

The school psychologists meet regularly to establish policies regarding students who require academic accommodations. In order to ensure that students who require accommodations have those accommodations considered and met to the best of the school‚Äôs ability to do so, families must submit a request as well as all official supporting documentation (504 Plans, IESP‚Äôs, etc.) to the school psychologists by June 1st for the upcoming school year. Based on the review of a student's file and documentation, the psychologists will use discretion to determine provision of accommodations. If, at any time, there is a concern about a student‚Äôs learning abilities, the school psychologists should be contacted. While there is no guarantee of provision of services during a given school year after the aforementioned June 1st deadline, the school will always do its best to accommodate and support the learning of all students with appropriate supporting documentation.

While many students receive services and support outside of Portledge School, for an additional fee, students, irrespective of documentation of learning needs, may meet with the Learning Specialist periodically to strengthen their study and organizational skills. 

Right to Refer to Outside Counseling
In the event that a student is found to be a danger to self or others, Portledge reserves the right to notify a parent/guardian, who then must report to campus to pick the student up. The parents/guardians must then consult with the School Psychologists to develop an acceptable plan of action. This plan of action must include as a precondition for return to School an evaluation by a mental-health professional who is not under the employ of Portledge School. Documentation of an evaluation allowing for the student to return to school must be provided to Portledge School prior to the student‚Äôs return to school.

College Counseling
It is the goal of the College Counseling team to provide thoughtful, purposeful, developmentally appropriate education about college admissions and applications to students in 9th‚Äì12th grades. This approach reduces stress, improves confidence, and increases the educational value of the college admissions process. Following is an overview of the program:

9th Grade: Focus on Planning and Decision-Making
9th-grade College Night focuses on how colleges evaluate, understanding choices and opportunities at Portledge School, understanding the standardized testing calendar, reviewing four year timeline.
9th graders may meet with their Upper School Dean at any time with questions regarding course schedules, extracurricular choices, summer plans, etc.


10th Grade: Focus on Exploring Options
10th-grade College Night features Admissions Officer speakers to learn about different types of schools and available options and encourages exploration.  
10th-grade class trip college tour in the spring (one day). 
10th graders may meet with their Upper School Dean at any time with questions regarding course schedules, extracurricular choices, summer plans, etc. but have their first formal College Counseling meeting in spring of 2026.


11th Grade: Focus on Finding Fit
The college application process officially kicks off in November.
11th-grade College Night focuses on organization, managing the process, and understanding the year ahead. Specific topics include: ways to apply, deadlines, testing, logistics, SCOIR online application management program.
All students have an individual meeting with their assigned college counselor followed by a family meeting to formally begin the application process. While each student will be assigned to a primary college counselor, it is important to note that the office functions as a team;  all students must begin the process with their primary assigned college counselor, they may also schedule meetings with any team member as needed or desired. No requests are taken for college counselor assignments or switches.
College Counseling individual and group meetings will cover the following topics:
Self-assessment
College Visits
College Interviews
Common Application
Essays


12th Grade:  Focus on Applying 
12th-grade College Night in September discusses immediate to-dos and longer-term considerations for the year.
Individual student and family meetings are scheduled as needed to support students working through the process with a particular focus on application completion and essay writing.

Apr. 28 at 6:30 p.m.: In-person College Night for 10th graders and their parents or guardians
Spring 2026 (Date TBD): One day 10th grade college trip

The Portledge College Counseling Team publishes college counseling resources on the College Counseling page of the Portledge School website and in the Resources section of myPortledge. Every 11th and 12th grade family should read the College Counseling Handbook thoroughly and use it as a reference.  

Portledge uses SCOIR, an online college search and application management system, as the primary means for students to communicate their final college lists to us. It is vital that each student and family logs into SCOIR and understands how to use it. Transcripts and other supporting documents will not be sent unless the college is listed appropriately in SCOIR.

The assigned College Counselor writes a letter of recommendation for each of their students (commonly known as the ‚ÄúSchool Statement‚Äù) addressing their academic trajectory throughout high school, role/s in our community, notable activities or involvement, and overall character and personal qualities. Letters often include insights from the advisor or Dean, and faculty comments from report cards. Parents and guardians are welcome to provide a written statement about their student that may also be used in the recommendation letter. Students also typically select two faculty members from core subject areas (teachers from 11th grade are generally preferable) to write academic letters of support. All letters of recommendation are confidential from the student and their parents or guardians.

Transcripts that include grades up to and including junior year, as well as coursework from senior year, will be sent to all colleges to which a student applies. 1st Quarter and 1st Semester senior grades are sent to colleges when a student asks that they be sent, a college asks for them, or the College Counselor sees such action as being in the best interests of the student. Additionally, the School will report any student suspensions that occur during the senior year.

The Upper School Deans/College Counselors will guide, advise and educate students about colleges and their admissions procedures and requirements, but the final responsibility lies with each student to make sure that details and deadlines have been addressed and met. It is critical that students follow the correct procedures and meet the Portledge College Counseling Office deadlines to ensure that all of the appropriate credentials are sent by the dates required by the colleges. In addition, students are responsible for sending standardized testing results to the colleges directly from the testing agency when this is required (see more on this below).  

Standardized Testing 
There are accommodation applications available for all students who have, and use, 504 or IESP accommodations throughout the school year. In order to apply, parents or guardians must reach out to one of the school psychologists. Each standardized testing organization will review documentation to make their own decision regarding accommodations. Further information can be found below in Testing Registration.

Test Descriptions
Parents/guardians are charged through particular third-party organizations or through the Business Office for testing services (e.g., PSAT, PreACT, IB, or AP) that are provided through the school. Detailed information about testing dates, fees, and registration deadlines is promulgated at appropriate times each school year, but much of the static information remains available on the Portledge website.

SSAT
The Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) is usually required of new applicants to independent schools who are entering 6th - 10th grades. Registration materials may be obtained from the Portledge Admissions Office or from Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey.

PSAT 8/9
The Preliminary SAT for 8th and 9th grade students is taken by 8th and 9th grade students at Portledge on Wednesday, March 11 and is administered by the school. This examination is meant as a preview of high-stakes standardized testing for students in age groups that may not otherwise have much exposure to such practice. Registration information will be promulgated by the Testing Coordinator beginning in January.

PSAT/NMSQT
The Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) is taken by sophomores and juniors on Wednesday, October 8 and is administered by the school. Scores from junior year are used for National Merit Scholarship Qualification (NMSQT) and for student and college-counselor use only. These scores are not sent to colleges. Registration information will be promulgated by the Testing Coordinator beginning in late July. Billing for all PSAT/NMQST test-takers is overseen by a third-party organization, APTS.

SAT
The SAT is administered by the College Board. The SAT consists of two sections:  Reading and Writing and Math. For more information on these exams, including test dates and registration information, please refer to the College Board website at www.collegeboard.org.

Pre-ACT 8/9
The Pre-ACT 8/9 is offered to 8th and 9th grade students on Saturday, April 25 and is administered by the school. This examination is meant as a preview of high-stakes standardized testing for students in age groups that may not otherwise have much exposure to such practice. Registration information will be promulgated by the Testing Coordinator beginning in February.

Pre-ACT
The Pre-ACT is offered to sophomores and juniors on Saturday, November 8 and is administered by the school. Students who are considering taking the ACT or who are unsure whether they wish to do so should seriously consider sitting for the Pre-ACT at least once. These scores are not sent to colleges. Registration information is promulgated by the Testing Coordinator beginning in late August.

ACT
The American College Testing program (ACT) is a popular alternative to the SAT and it is accepted by all colleges. Students can submit the ACT in lieu of the SAT reasoning test, the SAT Subject Tests, or both, depending on the college‚Äôs requirements. For more information, refer to their website at www.actstudent.org.

AP
Advanced Placement Exams (AP) are long-form, college-level tests prepared by ETS and given each May at Portledge. Students who are enrolled in AP course-work typically take the AP test in each AP course in which they are enrolled.  Portledge students who take the AP examination are exempted from the Portledge final examination in that course. Students can also register for independent study exams with the testing coordinator for courses that are not offered at Portedge. AP exams are not typically used in college admissions and are used instead for college placement or credit. However, they may be required for admission to colleges and universities outside the United States. Registration information for AP test takers, both those involved in corresponding Portledge coursework and those who have chosen to study independently, will be promulgated by the Testing Coordinator beginning in early September. Billing for all AP test-takers is overseen by a third-party organization, APTS. 

International Baccalaureate
International Baccalaureate Assessments are divided into two categories: External and Internal. External assessments (EA's) are formal examinations designed by the IBO. They are multiple-hour exams administered in May of Junior or Senior year, depending on the course. EA's are graded externally. Internal assessments (IA's) are designed by the IBO to be given and graded by the classroom teacher. IA's take varied forms, such as presentations, essays, or lab practicals, and they are spread out across the entirety of the course, whether it‚Äôs one year or two. IA grades are externally moderated to ensure global grading consistency. Students who elect to be Diploma Candidates Candidates are required to sit for all assessments in a given class. Course Candidates are not required to sit for IB Exams but may choose to do so. Course Candidates who sit for the IB Exam in a given area receive a certificate of completion. The school will bill each family for candidate and testing fees. Scores on EAs and IAs are weighted and averaged to determine a student's official score for an IB Class on a scale of 1-7. A Diploma Candidate must earn a combined score of at least 24 to earn an IB Diploma. A Certificate Candidate's score will be reflected on their certificate. Students who test may potentially earn college credit in given subject areas, depending on their levels of achievement and the requirements of the colleges in question.

PSAT 8/9, PSAT/NMSQT, PreACT 8/9, PreACT, SAT, and ACT Testing Registration
Freshmen are asked to register for the PSAT 8/9 and the PreACT 8/9 but are allowed to opt out if they so choose. 

Sophomores and juniors are asked to register for the PSAT/NMSQT but allowed to opt out if they so choose. 

Sophomores and juniors are encouraged to opt into the Pre-ACT.

It is the responsibility of the student to register for SAT and ACT tests via online registration. (Go to www.collegeboard.com or www.actstudent.org and sign up). You will need a valid, major credit card to register. The earlier you register, the better, and the more likely you are to get the local test center of your choice. Students should memorize the Portledge School Code --332883-- as well as their own social security number, and always use the exact same name when signing up for any tests. Susan M. Smith and Susie Smith will be treated as two different people, which can make sending scores to colleges more difficult. Be precise with your name, address, birth date, social security number and the Portledge School Code!

Testing Accommodations
Students with documented disabilities may apply for accommodations on these exams. Depending on the type(s) of accommodations for which students qualify, testing will either be at a national testing center or at Portledge School (school-based testing). Decisions about national vs. school-based testing are made by each individual testing agency and not Portledge School. Arrangements for accommodations on these tests must be made through the School Psychologist and each individual testing organization. The websites for the College Board or ACT can provide parents with the specific current requirements for documentation. Copies of this documentation must also be in Portledge School‚Äôs file. Students who may be seeking this sort of accommodation must speak with the School Psychologist at least 8 weeks in advance of the registration deadline date, since extra forms must be completed. 

Reporting Test Scores
The only way for colleges or the NCAA Eligibility Center to see your ‚Äòofficial‚Äô SAT or ACT scores is for you to arrange for official scores to be sent. They are not on the Portledge transcript, and it is your responsibility to send the scores.

Colleges will sometimes accept self-reported scores and will sometimes require official scores to be sent to them directly from the testing agency. When sending official scores, double check the college‚Äôs four-digit code to be certain that you are sending the scores to the correct college or university. The College Counseling Office does not send official SAT or ACT scores for students.

Disciplinary Policies: Maintaining Integrity
The central purposes of discipline at Portledge are to uphold the Portledge Pillars and reinforce community values; create a safe, warm and inclusive environment for every member of the community;  and teach students that their actions have consequences and that they are accountable for their behavior; moreover, our disciplinary practices aim to help students learn from their mistakes, develop character, and move forward in a positive direction. A student is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from Portledge or a decision not to permit subsequent re-enrollment, whenever the School determines that a student has engaged in conduct‚Äîwhether on or off campus, during or outside of regularly-scheduled school hours-that demonstrates a disregard for our Pillars of Kindness, Honor, Purpose, and Respect; that disrupts or otherwise interferes with the educational process of Portledge; that risks or endangers the safety of the student or others; that impairs the quality of life at Portledge; that is detrimental to the reputation of Portledge; or that otherwise brings discredit on the student or Portledge. Conduct that is subject to discipline includes both acts and omissions.

Upper School students have a special obligation to meet the high standards of personal conduct traditional at Portledge. The higher the grade level, the greater the expectations are for proper conduct. Respect for younger students, classmates, faculty, administrators and all other Portledge employees and guests is expected; foul language, rough play, and discourtesy fall outside the acceptable boundaries of a Panther‚Äôs behavior. Older students are expected to be positive role models for younger students. All students should be kind and seek to help one another whenever possible. Excessive noise and disruptive behavior are inappropriate on Portledge campus. Students should throw out their trash in the Commons (and all other areas on campus) and should leave the space better than they found it.

This Handbook outlines the various regulations and expectations that we have for Portledge students. It is expected that students will not only know and abide by these rules, but also that they will demonstrate thoughtful and courteous behaviors toward the school itself and all those associated with the school. If a breach occurs, a teacher should compose an infraction indicating that this breach has occurred. Cut classes and behavioral issues often lead to detention and/or Saturday detention. At the discretion of adults involved in the process, other consequences may also be considered in lieu of or in addition to Saturday detention. Seniors are reminded that loss of senior privileges in response to behavioral issues is likely. Earning multiple Saturday detentions could also result in disciplinary warning or possible suspension.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of disciplinary offenses, broken out into three levels; the discussion and list that follow do not in any way limit what has been said above with respect to discipline, re-enrollment, and the school‚Äôs policies and standards of conduct. The higher the level of offense, the more serious the misconduct. Punishment for disciplinary offenses may range from a verbal warning for more minor offenses to detention, suspension, loss of privileges, or expulsion for more serious misconduct. The punishment meted out will depend upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the severity of the misconduct, the age and grade level of the student, the frequency of the misconduct, the student‚Äôs overall discipline record, and the student‚Äôs overall performance at, and positive contributions to, Portledge.

Repeated violations may result in an otherwise Level I offense being treated as a Level II offense, or an otherwise Level II offense being treated as a Level III offense. A Level I offense will typically result in a verbal warning or after-school detention, a Level II offense in Saturday detention or suspension, and a Level III offense in suspension or dismissal from Portledge. 

Level I offenses include, but are not limited to, the following:
Tardiness 
Use of profanity
Lack of courtesy
Littering or leaving a mess on campus
Dress code violations
Parking violations
Food and beverage consumption outside designated areas
Failure to keep appointments with instructors
Unexcused absence from advisory, class meeting or town meeting

Level II offenses include, but are not limited to, the following:
Violation of off-campus privileges
Disrespectful behavior
Disruptive behavior
Aggressive behavior
Unexcused absence from class
Failure to promptly return school property
Repeated unexcused absences from advisory, class meetings or town meetings
Chronic tardiness
Use or possession of tobacco, nicotine, e-cigarette and/or vaping products or paraphernalia in any form
Possession of replica, inoperable, toy or model weapons
Disrespectful or unsportsmanlike conduct directed at players, coaches, game officials, or visitors from other schools. 
Violation of our policies on the Acceptable Use of Computers and Cell Phones

Level III offenses include, but are not limited to, the following:

Other conduct, behavior, action, or circumstance, whether on or off campus, that impairs the quality of life at Portledge, is detrimental to the School‚Äôs reputation, or endangers others


Examples of Academic Infractions
The most serious forms of academic dishonesty are plagiarism and cheating. When students cheat, plagiarize or otherwise act dishonestly, they are harming themselves and compromising the entire educational community. The intellectual health of the School is drawn from the trust and respect of its students and faculty. 

If students should find themselves in a situation where they are considering making a decision which may be academically dishonest, they are strongly encouraged to contact their teacher, advisor, or Dean.

Plagiarism is defined in Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Dictionary as: ‚Äú...steal[ing[ and pass[ing] off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own.‚Äù  Giving credit to the source of material is an essential requirement of scholarship. When in doubt about the necessity of footnoting or the proper method of citation, the student should always consult a teacher.  Students are reminded that even if plagiarism is discovered long after an assignment is submitted, disciplinary consequences still may be invoked. Furthermore, our policies on plagiarism extend beyond written assignments to any form of scholarly work, including but not limited to speeches, works of music and art, scientific research, inventions, or computer code. 

Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces unique and fascinating elements into the discourse around genuine scholarship and authorship. Similarly, it opens up tremendous possibilities for new and innovative approaches to learning and strategies for scholarship. However, in order for these exciting developments to serve as aids to student growth, it is essential that students engage with AI tools in ethical manners that are prescribed by individual teachers. AI is external to the student; hence, either its work products are derived from a source other than the student or the student‚Äôs work has been rewritten, recast, or reordered by AI. As such, use of AI must be appropriately identified and cited as such when used with teacher permission in order to ensure maintenance of academic integrity. In such cases as AI use may be permitted by an instructor for an individual assignment, use of said AI must be appropriately cited and credited in the manners prescribed by that instructor. Unauthorized use of AI constitutes plagiarism; the same can be said for use of AI without appropriate citation, whether its use was allowed in some limited manner by the instructor or not. As instructors and students learn to navigate this new tool in education, it is likely that approaches to its use as a whole will shift, both at Portledge and beyond it. What will not change is our core commitment to the principle of Honor, which implies academic integrity and the tenets of this particular policy.

As guiding principles, students should ask themselves at least a few basic questions. For example: :
Are these my words?
Are these my thoughts?
Is this my process/work?

AI, when used responsibly, is not an end product or a source to develop an end product. It can be used responsibly as a potential partner for the fostering and development of intellectual curiosity.

Cheating most frequently refers to unauthorized collaboration on homework assignments, tests or quizzes or to the use of unauthorized notes during an examination. The fact that some teachers sometimes encourage students to work together or allow open-book examinations does not constitute permission to do so in other instances. When in doubt, the student should always consult their teacher. In testing situations, a student should never have unauthorized aids nearby. Items such as texts, notes, cell phones, or flashcards must be properly secured. Further, unauthorized use of references such as SparkNotes, Wikipedia (or the like), downloads, or English translations of foreign-language works are also considered to be acts of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty erodes the underpinnings of a school. At minimum, a student should earn a zero for the assignment, in addition to an official report of the incident. If and when the teacher documents a significant academic dishonesty issue or a series of less significant ones, the school often calls the Honor Council into session and imposes further consequences. Moreover, as in all cases in which Level 3 offenses have occurred, the Upper School Administrative Team  maintains the right to impose consequences as needed, with or without a prior convening of the Honor Council.

The following are also considered serious infractions: all forms of dishonesty; disrespect toward faculty or staff; contempt or disregard for the school, for other people, or for their possessions; fighting or physical abuse; rude behavior or profanity; verbal or written abuse of or toward another, including prank phone calls, e-mails or internet postings, cyber bullying, sexting; graffiti; gambling; cutting classes or unexcused absence from school (including leaving campus without permission); inappropriate behavior on school buses; dealing, use, possession, or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at school or school functions; vaping, and use or possession of tobacco at school or school functions. 

Involvement with alcohol or drugs or drug paraphernalia may be grounds for immediate dismissal from Portledge School. At their discretion, the Head of School or Division Director may require that a student undergo an alcohol/drug assessment at a school-approved facility at the parent/guardian‚Äôs expense. Results are to be shared with the School in such circumstances as a precondition for return to campus. Firearms and other weapons are not allowed on school property.  Portledge may question a student about a disciplinary matter without their parents‚Äô being present. Similarly, student lockers, book bags, pockets, cars, etc. may be searched. Once any property or belongings are on school property, they are subject to search by the Head of School, Division Director or Dean of Students.

Portledge has a school-wide policy concerning harassment in-person and online. A copy of that policy is later in this document. 

The school may discipline, or even expel, a student who, for example, is arrested or behaves in some unbecoming manner on the internet or off school grounds.

Enforcement of Disciplinary Policies
Level I offenses:  
Typically will be handled by the classroom teacher, or the Dean of Students. Level I violations will commonly result in after-school detentions or other appropriate consequences. Repeated Level I infractions may result in harsher penalties, including suspension. The Dean of Students will schedule and the Upper School Deans will monitor after-school detentions. 

Behavioral offenses, as defined above under Level I, typically will be handled by the classroom teacher and/or the Dean of Students. 

The Dean of Students or an Upper School Dean will initiate a conversation with any student for whom lateness is a concern. If lateness becomes a persistent issue, at the discretion of the Dean of Students, an after-school detention will be assigned. The detention will ideally be served during the same week of the infraction. 

Level II offenses 
Typically will be handled by the Dean of Students. If it is determined that a Level II violation has occurred, a Saturday or after-school detention is likely. Saturday detentions will be scheduled by the Dean of Students. Saturday detentions will be supervised by at least one member of the Upper School Administration (Director of Upper School, Dean of Students, Associate Director of Upper School, or Upper School Deans). More detailed information about Saturday detentions is outlined later in this document. 

Upon an unexcused absence from class, the student will be summoned to have a conversation with the Dean of Students or one of the Upper School Deans, and a detention will be assigned. 

More serious behavioral offenses as defined above under Level II,  typically will be handled by the Dean of Students, in partnership with members of the Dean Team. Consequences are then determined in conjunction with the Director of Upper School.

Level III offenses
Primary responsibility rests with the Director of the Upper School, with the assistance of the Dean of Students and the Upper School Deans. Upon receiving information suggesting that a Level III violation may have occurred, the Dean of Students will investigate the facts to determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Level III violation has occurred. 

The Director of the Upper School may then, at his discretion, refer the matter to the Honor Council and, as described below, the Dean of Students will inform the student, the student‚Äôs advisor, the student‚Äôs Dean, and the student‚Äôs parents/guardians of the referral. 

After reporting the situation to the Director of the Upper School, he may, at his discretion, refer the matter to the Honor Council, as detailed below.

Minor breaches of discipline are typically resolved by counseling the student. Repetition of infractions may result in consequences, such as detention, or in a conference with the advisor, an Upper School Dean,  the Dean of Students, and/or the Division Director. Persistence of minor infractions, especially when more than one detention has already been served by a student, may result in Disciplinary Warning or Suspension. Serious forms of misbehavior often result in detention and may additionally require the convening of the Honor Council or Administrative Disciplinary Committee (ADC). The Honor Council may consider suspension, while the ADC may consider expulsion or other consequences beyond detention. Additionally, such consequences may be considered and assigned by the Division Director without the convening of such councils. In certain extreme cases, the Head of School may dismiss a student without convening these committees. In all disciplinary situations, parents will be updated as appropriate by a member of the school community. It is also within the authority of the Division Director, Dean of Students, the Upper School Deans, or Head of School to question a student at school without parental consent or presence.

Honor Council, Upper School
The Honor Council has been established in accordance with Portledge‚Äôs belief that all students should receive fair and equal treatment in the event of a major rule infraction involving the honor code or academic dishonesty. The Honor Council ensures that students brought before the council understand what it means to be a Portledge citizen and scholar; offers fair, just, and equitable disciplinary options; upholds the Portledge pillars; and understands that all cases are to be treated with the greatest levels of discretion and confidentiality.
Honor Council consists of no more than five student members per grade, selected by a committee of Portledge faculty and administrators. To be eligible to apply for Honor Council, a student must 1) have no grades below C in the current school year; 2) have no effort grades below 3 for any course in the current school year; 3) not be on academic or disciplinary warning in the current school year; 4) have completed all community-service requirements for the current school year; 5) be entering the appropriate grade for the intended position; and 6) submit a formal application to the selection committee.  When empaneled for a hearing, the honor council includes four students, ideally one per grade and four Upper School faculty members. 

After an initial inquiry and investigation by the Dean of Students, the Dean of Students will decide whether to bring the infraction to the Honor Council. In some cases, the Director of the Upper School will resolve the incident at his/her discretion. When a matter is to be heard by the Honor Council, the Dean of Students shall notify the student and their parents of the scheduling of the hearing. The student may be accompanied at the hearing by their dean, their advisor, or another faculty member with whom they feel comfortable. Parents/guardians do not attend the meeting. Prior to the hearing, the Dean of Students will prepare a written statement and  appropriately apprise the Council of the fact pattern as needed. This statement describes the infraction in detail and is used as a tool of guidance for the group in working towards a recommendation. At the hearing, the Dean of Students presents the findings of the investigation. The student is then brought before the Honor Council, together with their chosen advocate, to present their account of the incident at issue and to answer questions from Council members. The accompanying advocate may also speak on behalf of the student‚Äôs character, but not specifically in reference to the details of the matter at hand. The party potentially harmed by the conduct is also invited to give an accounting of their perspective; however, no other witnesses are permitted to testify. No formal rules of evidence or procedure apply to the hearing. The Director of the Upper School, the Dean of Students, the student, and the accompanying faculty member then depart, and the Council deliberates.

If the Council finds that a Level III violation has occurred, it makes a disciplinary recommendation to the Director of the Upper School, who may accept, amend, or override it. Once the decision has been made, the Director of the Upper School contacts the student‚Äôs parents/guardians with the decision, and the Dean of Students writes up the official infraction and consequence for the record.

The Head of School and the Director of Upper School also have discretion not to refer a Level III incident to the Council and to make their discipline decision without a referral.  If it is determined that a Level III offense has occurred, a suspension is likely and expulsion a possibility. Two or more Level III violations in a four-year period are more likely to result in expulsion. In addition, students who commit a Level III violation during the senior year and particularly during the second semester may be  prohibited from  participating in year-end events, including Graduation. The decision may be appealed to the Division Director by the student or their parents/guardians.

Honor Council
This school year, the Honor Council representatives for Upper School are:

Class of 2026: 
Kennedy Abrahams, Brendan Ding, Sabrina Hemley, Aria Mannering, and Melody Zhang
Class of 2027: 
Soleil Can, Everleigh Daniels, Eian Kiyashka, Finn Scott and Remy Terranova
Class of 2028: 
Alexis Bernard, Ava Gross, Eliza Li, Theo Pasztor and Olivia Potter
Class of 2029 Honor Council representatives will be elected following the annual 9th grade trip to Blairstown early in school year 2025‚Äì2026.

Detention
After-school detentions: For Level I and some Level II violations, students may receive after-school detention to be served after the school day from 3:45pm to 4:30pm as scheduled by the Dean of Students. Students will report to a designated space to serve after-school detention as per the instructions of the Dean of Students. Students who fail to report or are tardy to after-school detention will face additional consequences.

Saturday detentions are scheduled by the Dean of Students and require two to three hours of work or study on campus. These mandatory Saturday detentions, when possible, are held at school from 8:00 a.m. sharp until 11:00 a.m. Students are required to arrive promptly, to be in dress code, and to bring sufficient schoolwork to keep them fully engaged during the entire three-hour period. A student who fails to attend detention (or who fails to be on time, in dress code, or studiously engaged) faces the risk of being suspended from school for one day at the beginning of the next week and/or being placed in subsequent Saturday detentions. Students serving detentions must remember that their actions are what caused the placement in detention. Because detention is serious, there are virtually no acceptable reasons/excuses for a detention to be missed.
 
Note: If a student cannot attend on Saturday for religious reasons, a specially scheduled detention will be arranged. The Dean of Students must be notified well in advance of the Saturday detention date in order for this to be approved. Students who earn regular Saturday detentions place themselves at risk for additional disciplinary action, including suspension.

Suspensions
Suspensions may take one of two forms as determined by the Director of the Upper School:
At-home suspension whereby the student is not allowed to attend any school activity or event or come to campus for any reason.
On occasion, the administration may determine that a student should serve their suspension on campus. These in-school suspensions at Portledge include:
Isolation in a supervised space
No contact with other students during the period of suspension
Mandated departure after the school day; no participation in any school activity will be permitted, including sports and other extracurriculars.

Students that have been suspended for cheating or plagiarism will receive a grade of ‚Äú0‚Äù on the work in question. Students will not return to class until all reflection essays, letters of apology, and assignments are completed to the satisfaction of their teachers, their Dean, and the Dean of Students. 

Teachers are not obligated to provide make-up lessons or extra help for students who have been suspended, nor should they be inconvenienced in any way because of a student‚Äôs suspension. Students in suspension should stay current on their work and are permitted to email their instructors to clarify and complete their assignments. In addition, students will complete a satisfactory assigned essay, reflection or apology during their suspension; guidelines for judging these assignments will be made clear. Students will also be responsible for turning in all of the day‚Äôs homework and any work completed in class upon returning to school from the suspension. 

Suspension is the gravest consequence, short of expulsion, that the School may invoke. In effect, suspension serves as a short-term expulsion in order to drive home to the student what it is like not to be a member of the Portledge community. The school hopes that the student will respond to the serious nature of the suspension by redirecting their behaviors more positively. A student who does not heed the warning of a suspension, however, faces expulsion as the next logical response to a continued lack of good citizenship.        

Notice of a suspension, or other disciplinary action, is put in the student‚Äôs file. Students who are suspended for behavior issues generally do not suffer additional grade consequences outside of missed time at school. Students who are suspended are not permitted to represent the school in extracurricular activities, in games, or at practices. When the Honor Council recommends suspension, they also make recommendations about the length of the suspension.  

At the end of their junior year, any student who has been externally suspended during their 9th‚Äì11th grade and wishes to have their record expunged so that the suspension need not be reported during the college application process must petition the ADC in writing. The appeal must come directly from the student, not a parent/guardian, and it should be addressed to the Division Director, who chairs the ADC. Students may submit appeals as early as June 15; all appeals must be submitted in writing by Aug. 15. Once an appeal is received, the Division Director notifies the potential members of the ADC that a meeting is being sought. The goal is for the meeting to take place during the first few weeks of the appellant's senior year; this timeline allows for a sufficient opportunity to consider removing the suspension from external-facing permanent record. The student is expected to appear at the meeting in order to discuss the potential expunging of the record. In advance, the student prepares with their advisor or another trusted adult, who appears with the student at the meeting and may be questioned separately about the student. The outcome of the ADC will determine whether or not a student must report the suspension during the college application process.

All suspensions that occur during senior year remain part of the student‚Äôs record and are reported to colleges. Students are encouraged to report such suspensions, with a letter of explanation, before Portledge sends that information.

In-School Suspensions
Although the goal of suspension is to separate the student from the community, the School also recognizes that there is sometimes value in having a student serve a suspension at school. In these cases, the student is still separated from the community, but teachers are able to supervise the student and require that work be completed during the suspension. Additionally, it may be required that homework be completed, that an apology be written, or that an assignment or project be re-done (for example, in the case of plagiarism or dishonesty). Students do not have a voice in deciding if a suspension will be served at home or in school. In-school suspensions are maintained as an internal record, but these suspensions are not automatically reported to colleges as part of the application process. As such, there is no process to expunge such suspensions. The decision belongs to the Division Director.

Administrative Discipline Committee (ADC)
The Administrative Discipline Committee is made up of school Administrators. A quorum of at least seven administrators is required for an official ADC meeting to take place. This committee is chaired by the Director of the Upper School; the Director calls an ADC into session whenever there is a case regarding possible expulsion from school or whenever the committee has been asked to hear a case for expungement of a suspension.  The ADC can also hear cases that are too serious or too sensitive for or above the jurisdiction of the Honor Council. Along with the Director of the Upper School, six additional Administrators (not including the Head of School) sit on the committee. The Head of School is a non-voting member of the committee. Following the meeting, the student and family are informed of decisions regarding next steps by the Director of Upper School. All disciplinary appeals will be heard by the Head of School. Appeals must be in writing and delivered to the Head‚Äôs office within 48 hours of the decision. 

Warnings (Academic or Disciplinary)
The Head of School or Division Director may place a student on Academic Warning if scholastic achievement is below par or on Disciplinary Warning for behavior.  By placing a student on notice, the school is warning the student formally that they are not meeting Portledge‚Äôs academic or behavioral expectations. Simultaneously, the School is asking the student to respond with initiative and positive action so that the Warning may be reviewed and rescinded after a set period of time. If it is perceived that a student on Warning is unwilling or unable to change their performance, then the school must question the desirability of having that individual continue at Portledge.

Academic Warning
To progress to the next grade, and to be considered for a Portledge diploma, a student must earn no fewer than five credits each year and have no failures in required courses. At the end of each quarter, any student with two or more D‚Äôs, three or more grades in the C range, or a failing grade in any course is considered for placement on Academic Warning.

Seniors on Academic Warning are restricted to campus. Parents are notified when a student is placed on Academic Warning. The student‚Äôs dean and advisor play key roles in overseeing performance during this probationary period. If a student on Academic Warning is playing on an athletic team, the Division Director will determine whether curtailing this activity will serve the best academic interest of the student. Similarly, the Division Director will determine if participation in other extracurricular activities should be curtailed. The usual duration for Academic Warning is one semester. Failure to resolve Academic Warning status during the semester or through summer work may necessitate the student‚Äôs withdrawal from Portledge School. The probationary period may be extended at the discretion of the Head of School or the Division Director. Portledge School reserves the right to withhold the student contract of any student who is, or has been, on Academic Warning.

Disciplinary Warning
A student may be placed on Disciplinary Warning after they have been involved in a breach of a school rule or in a series of on-going, chronic behavioral problems. The school expects that a student on Disciplinary Warning will demonstrate subsequent responsible actions that indicate not only that the behavior was out-of-character for that student but also that the student can maintain consistently good behavior. The Division Director reviews the student‚Äôs status after a set period of time. If improvement has been noted, the Warning will be lifted. If, however, a student is involved in other breaches of conduct while on Disciplinary Warning, they will be liable to more stringent action (including suspension or expulsion) at the discretion of the Honor Council or ADC, the Division Director, or the Head of School.  Portledge School reserves the right to withhold the student contract of any student who is or has been on Disciplinary Warning.  

Expulsion
Expulsion immediately removes a student from the school. Only the ADC or Head of School determines if a student will be expelled. Any student who has been expelled (or one who has not been granted re-enrollment because of disciplinary issues) is not permitted to visit when school is in session or during on-campus athletic or social events.


Student Life
Student Life Committee
The Student Life Committee is chaired by a member of the school faculty and consists of faculty members from each division and others with cross-divisional responsibilities. This committee meets to discuss issues surrounding student life and policies pertaining to peer-to-peer interactions. The SLC works to create programs that will enhance the students‚Äô experience at Portledge.

Student Council
In the spring of each year, students in 8th‚Äì11th grades elect Upper School students as the Student Council Executive Board (President, Vice-President, Treasurer and Secretary) for the next year. Rising 10th-12th grade students also elect their respective Class Officers (President and Vice-President for the following school year each spring.  Since 9th grade is a new entry year for several students, Class Officer elections take place in the fall. Candidates for all elected offices must be in good academic standing (no current-school-year grades below C and current school-year effort grades must not be below 3 for any course), with a good disciplinary record ( freedom from academic or disciplinary warning), and must have completed their community service requirement before formally running for office.  The Student Council Handbook, available to students through the resources section of myPortledge, details the mission and bylaws, eligibility standards, election protocols, responsibilities, and conduct and performance expectations for all members of the Student Council.  

Student Council Executive Board members serve as the leadership team for the entire student body of all three divisions. The Student Council Executive Board and Class Officers work to improve school culture by helping to organize and coordinate school-wide activities and weekly upper school town meetings, liaising with the upper school administrative team and generally promoting school spirit. 

This year‚Äôs Upper School Student Council members are:
Executive Board: 
Mason Lee, '26, President 
Kyle Lee, '26, Vice President
Olga Markovic, '26, Treasurer
Daniel Kadirov, '26, Secretary

Class Representatives:
Class of 2026: 
Will Rigg, President; Rondell Rabsatt, Vice President
Class of 2027: 
Eddie Mercier, President; Juliet Palatnik, Vice President
Class of 2028: 
Gunnar Franson, President; Hope Barnett, Vice President
The Class of 2029 will hold elections for Class Officers early in school year 2025-2026 following the annual trip to Blairstown.

Honor Statement
All programs and activities at Portledge have been chosen and designed in accordance with the School‚Äôs Mission Statement and Philosophy.  Portledge expects its students to remember that academic honesty is a foundation-block to scholarship.  To affirm and reinforce this fundamental tenet, we require that students, formally attest to these ideals each fall:

The Portledge Honor Statement and Character Code:
‚ÄúI affirm that when I submit work for grading, or take tests or quizzes, the work will be my own work that I completed without the use of unauthorized help.‚Äù
‚ÄúI agree to conduct myself at Portledge, in the community, and online in a manner that demonstrates ethical action, moral courage, and honesty toward myself and others. I agree to behave in a manner that will reflect the values of my school and my family at all times.‚Äù
Portledge takes this pledge very seriously and expects its students to do likewise.  The School assumes that each student fully understands what constitutes plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty and that if they are not sure, they will ask a responsible adult at the school. The school will seriously question the continuation of any student who is unable or unwilling to abide by the Honor Statement.  


Dress Regulations
The Portledge Pillars of Kindness, Honor, Purpose and Respect provide the framework for student conduct expectations. As such, students are expected to dress each day in clothing that respects and supports the purposeful work of a serious academic community. Please read the following  link carefully: 

9th‚Äì12th Grade Dress Code


Dress Regulations Enforcement/Consequences
When a faculty member notices a student out of Dress Code, they refer the student to the Dean of Students.
The Dean of Students or their designee (typically an Upper School Dean) has a conversation with the student and makes note of a first offense for that particular student.
The Dean of Students or their designee generates an infraction that indicates that the student was out of dress code, and that if it happens again, the student is likely to receive a detention.
At the next offense, the student will report to the Dean of Students or their designee for a conversation, and a detention or another appropriate consequence will be issued by the Dean of Students, to be served before or after school within a week of the infraction.
The Dean of Students will keep a record of how many dress code violations a student has accumulated, and chronic, repeat offenses may lead to more significant consequences. All students start with a clean slate at the beginning of each semester. 


Students and families should be aware that it is the responsibility of all members of faculty and administration to enforce all school rules, including ones regarding appropriate dress. As such, they should expect that teachers will actively address all such matters with students as they occur. While it is never comfortable or pleasant to engage in such conversations, we expect that faculty, students, and parents/guardians will engage in such conversations in good faith and with good humor to the best of their ability to do so. Certainly, all such conversations should leave all participants feeling seen, heard, and valued, even if the results of such conversations do not necessarily leave all participants feeling particularly victorious or joyful. 

Driving and/0r Riding as a Passenger On Campus
Cars, MotorBikes and Mopeds
Students are not permitted to drive on campus with the following exceptions:
Students who possess a New York State driver‚Äôs license may drive motor cars to and from school once their parents have read and signed the parent permission agreement on myPortledge, they have registered with the office, passed the Portledge driving quiz, and placed a Portledge sticker on their windshield as required. 

A Junior License does not qualify for driving privileges to Portledge. The vehicles must remain parked and locked during the school day, with the single exception of those seniors with permission to leave campus.  If you are a licensed driver and expect to be driving to school even occasionally, you MUST complete a school registration form available on myPortledge and pass the Portledge driving quiz. Student vehicles are to be parked only in the designated Upper School parking area. Cars may not be driven between buildings during the school day.  Please always yield to pedestrians. Do not use cell phones while driving on campus. The Head of School, Division Director, or Assistant Division Director may revoke the driving privileges of any student at any time during the year as they see fit. In such cases, parents must be prepared to provide transportation to and from school for their children as stated on the aforementioned parent agreement.

Motorbikes and mopeds are not permitted on campus. 

Bicycles
Because there is no proper bicycle route on Duck Pond and Piping Rock Roads, the school does not encourage bicycles as a mode of transportation to school. Students may, however, ride bicycles to school with a parent/guardian‚Äôs consent and subject to the following provisions: 
We do not have bike racks on campus.
With increased congestion at arrival and departure times we do not consider it safe to ride bicycles on campus. Therefore, arrival must be no later than 7:45 a.m.
The bicycle must be parked and locked in the area by the baseball field near the Duck Pond Road entrance to Portledge.
Parents should notify the Upper School office if their student is riding a bicycle to school and will be walking from the baseball field to their school building.
Portledge is not responsible for the bicycle's security.


Students Riding with Student Drivers 
Students may not ride as passengers with other students driving with the following exceptions:
Seniors who have written parental permission on file in the Upper School Office may ride with Seniors who drive during the school day or after school to official school functions. Seniors may not drive other younger students to school or from school. Students may not drive classmates to bus dismissal. Juniors who have full New York State licenses may not drive other students. Unusual or extenuating circumstances may be considered individually by the Assistant Director of Upper School.

Speed Limit - All Adults and Students Please Take Note
Adults should model appropriate behaviors for children to emulate. With that in mind, parents/guardians and students are reminded that the speed limit for the entire campus is 15 mph.  Always yield to pedestrians.  Never use a cell phone when driving.  

Dismissal Procedure 
All Upper and Middle School students who depart by bus will be picked up at the Upper School. Buses will be called out by the faculty member on bus duty by the Upper School. Buses will depart from the Upper School beginning at 3:40 p.m. Students who are traveling by bus must be ready for dismissal at the Upper School by this time. During inclement weather, students may wait in the college counseling area, but they are responsible for attending to when their bus arrives and the monitor calls it.
 
All Upper and Middle School students who depart by car will be picked up at the Middle School or at the Upper School. When cars enter campus to pick up a student from the Middle School, they must turn right onto the service road just after our entrance. Cars will travel down the service road towards the Middle School. Upon exiting the service road, cars will continue behind Alumni House and turn left to pull up in front of Powers Courtyard, in single file. All Upper and Middle School car pick up students will be waiting in Powers Courtyard and will be escorted to their car by monitors as needed unless their preference is to be picked up by the Upper School. Students who wait to be picked up by the Upper School should be aware that bus dismissal takes precedence and occurs first when both cars and buses are free to do pickup. Students are not permitted to cross fields and get into cars still waiting in line for pickup. Such practices are dangerous for our students and often then lead to further poor driving. Students who violate the rules around pickup locations and procedures will incur disciplinary consequences, with detention likely. We ask the cooperation and indulgence of all parents/guardians driving on campus in following these rules, as well; unsafe driving endangers our community and will not be permitted. During inclement weather, students will wait in Bahnik Hall, and monitors will call them when their car arrives. 

Note: The main road on our campus will be closed to all incoming traffic from the Lower School stop sign to the Middle School from 3:15 p.m. to 3:50 p.m. No cars will be allowed to travel past the stop sign towards the lower end of campus. The road will re-open at 3:50 p.m. each afternoon. If your child is departing by car from the Upper or Middle School, you are encouraged to come before 3:10 p.m. or after 4:00 p.m. This will ease congestion on our campus and will allow you to pick up your child with greater ease from their specific division.

Safety is our top priority, so we are requesting that you obey these guidelines, which will allow for a smooth departure. Please also make sure you follow the directions of all guards/monitors on campus to help facilitate dismissal. As always, please drive slowly and cautiously on campus.

Physical Education and Athletics 
Below is a brief version of Athletic Department policies.  For complete information and details of Athletic Department  policies, please refer to the Athletic Department Student Parent Handbook on the Portledge website. 

General Philosophy
The athletic program aims to pursue excellence by providing an educational, enjoyable and competitive experience that allows students to develop personally and athletically. A successful program creates an environment that is inclusive, fosters growth, and nurtures individual talents that emphasize the Portledge Pillars of Kindness, Honor, Purpose, and Respect that are necessary for lifelong learning. The athletic department believes that sports are a great way for our students to learn valuable skills like sportsmanship, teamwork, and sacrifice that will serve them in all walks of life.

Athletics involves many student-athletes, and because it provides a forum to bring students, parents, and faculty together, a successful interscholastic athletic program is vital to community spirit at Portledge.

Our mission is to reinforce our community ethos and well-being via synergies of athletics and body movement as they relate to growth and learning. 

Attendance Philosophy
The Portledge Athletics Attendance Policy is a simple one; attendance is expected at all practices and games. This holds true for Middle School and Upper School athletics. The expectation when a student-athlete joins a roster is that they are aware of the season length and make arrangements so that they are present. 

There are three types of reasons an athlete may miss a practice/game:
Emergency Beyond their Control
For these types of reasons, there will be no consequences. 
An absence where the athlete notifies the coach or the Athletic Department
There are a wide range of reasons that may fall into this category. We expect Portledge athletes to communicate with their coaches in the rare event that they will not be present. Coaches and players will work together and demonstrate understanding, but ongoing absences could result in role shifts on the team. 
An absence where the athlete does not notify the coach
Athletes are subject to the above reduction in responsibilities, as well as further disciplinary action. A pattern of not notifying the coaches and not being at practice could result in dismissal from the program.

Transportation
Reliance Bus Company is the provider of transportation for the Portledge Athletic Department. Student-athletes and coaches are responsible for upholding the Portledge Pillars on buses. Students should remain seated and buckled and maintain proper bus safety protocols. Students seeking to drive themselves to or from games or practices should consult with Mr. Daniel Kapps concerning those situations; there is a release form associated with them, and occasions of not traveling with the teams should be limited as much as possible. Additionally, only students with Portledge driving permission will be considered during any such consultations.


Academic Philosophy
As it relates to the term ‚ÄúStudent-Athlete‚Äù, the Portledge Athletic Department values the ‚Äústudent‚Äù as much as the ‚Äúathlete‚Äù. The members of our programs should be putting forth their best effort in the community and the classroom in addition to the fields, courts, and rinks. As such, students need to be achieving the following to participate in athletics:
Grades in all their classes of at least a C-, and meeting attendance and participation expectations. 
Effort Grades of 1 through 3
The student has not committed any acts of academic dishonesty. 


Consequences for these actions can vary and dismissal from a team can occur for a designated time period, an entire season, or a full year. 

Community Philosophy
Our student-athletes are representatives of Portledge School. There are many people who have their first and/or most consistent interactions with Portledge students by observing our athletes before, during, and after competitions. It is important that our student-athletes are strong community members both on our campus and while representing the school off-campus. Disciplinary infractions will be monitored by the athletic department. If a pattern of inappropriate behavior is observed, the privilege of competing for the Portledge Athletic Program could be suspended or removed. 

Junior Varsity Athletics
Junior Varsity Teams hold a special place in an athletic program. They are multifaceted programs that serve the needs of a variety of students. JV teams may include:
Highly skilled 7th or 8th graders that have passed the APP to play Upper School Sports
Upper School students who are not yet ready for the Varsity level and need a place to hone their skills before becoming a contributing member of a Varsity team.
Upper School students who enjoy playing a sport and may never be ready to contribute on the Varsity level. Having a JV program allows for students to come to this conclusion on their own time and do so while playing the sport they love, rather than sitting on a Varsity bench.

For all of these reasons, Junior Varsity serves as a bridge between a Middle School program that leans heavily on participation and the Varsity teams in those sports that are fielded for competition. There are no playing-time guarantees at this level but a balanced schedule will allow all students an opportunity to contribute. The final decision regarding participation on Junior Varsity or Varsity programs will be made by the coaching staffs in conjunction with the Athletic Department. 

Competitions for Junior Varsity will take place primarily on the weekdays, with a few possible Saturday contests. Practices and games will almost never take place on Sunday or Holidays. The time commitment for JV sports, when factoring in practices and games, is 5 days a week with the occasional 6-day week. On rare occasions, practices and games may extend into school breaks.

Varsity Athletics
Varsity teams are fielded to win. To be clear, the idea is not to chase winning at all costs, as our Pillars and philosophies must still be observed. However, at this level, competition supersedes participation and skill-building. Certain levels of sport-based acumen and athletic talent are needed to participate in competitions. While in theory a student could go an entire season without seeing playing time, a balanced schedule and good coaching will, in most cases, avoid that happening. 

Competitions and practices at the Varsity level require a commitment to 6 days of athletics. Not all weeks will include all 6 days, but the frequency of play on Saturdays is higher at this level. Practices and Competitions will almost never be on Sundays or Holidays. The most common exception would be if a Varsity team or athlete advanced to a NYSAIS Final which could be scheduled on a Sunday.  On rare occasions, practices and games may extend into school breaks.

Physical Education Philosophy
Upper School Physical Education focuses on meeting the NYS requirements of keeping students active and allowing them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Upper School PE will combine skill-building exercises with various activities that will make for an enjoyable experience for students who choose not to compete in interscholastic athletics. 

Current Upper School Sports Team Offerings
Fall Sports:
Varsity Boys Soccer, JV Boys Soccer, Varsity Girls Soccer, Varsity Girls Tennis, Varsity Girls Volleyball, Varsity Coed Cross Country, Coed Crew

Participation in all sports will incur charges for some needed practice gear and parts of the uniform that athletes keep.

Participation in Ice Hockey, Golf, and Squash will incur additional fees for transportation, facility rental, and/or equipment.

Practice Apparel and Required Equipment 
For practices, athletes will be required to wear Portledge Apparel. In some instances, this piece of apparel will be provided by the Athletic Department and charged to the student‚Äôs account. In other instances, apparel for practice will be available in the Panther Den. If a student-athlete develops a pattern of being without their practice apparel or needed equipment (for example, cleats for soccer or a racket for tennis), then a discussion with the athletic department about continuing with the sport or transitioning to P.E. will occur. 

Athletic Webpage
We encourage you to make use of the athletic section of the Portledge website (www.portledge.org/athletics), as well as myPortledge. These will both provide you with location, game time and estimated pickup time for all athletic events on a particular day. Please keep in mind factors such as delayed start times, elongated games, and traffic all factor into an adjustment of pick up times and are not known ahead of time. In the case of inclement weather, an email will be sent out as soon as information is available (usually between noon and 1:00 p.m).

Varsity Team Managers
In some cases, students may choose to be Student Managers of a varsity team for their Physical Education credit.  Student Managers must attend all games (home and away) and practices at the coach‚Äôs discretion.  Any problems in the area of attendance or attitude should be reported to the Athletic Department as soon as possible.

Student Physical Education Requirement
Each Upper School student is required to complete two semesters of physical education each year. A season‚Äôs requirement may be met through (a) participation on a Portledge varsity or junior varsity team, (b) participation in a physical education class, or (c) in limited cases, by receiving an Athletic Exemption through participation in an approved special alternate program or co-curricular Portledge activity (ie: Drama, Art, Music) (see ‚ÄúExemptions‚Äù below).


Exemptions Requirements
In limited cases, student-athletes may apply for an exemption from participating in an athletic season. Normally, exemptions are granted for only one athletic season per year. However, multiple-season exemptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Athletic Director. Students wishing to apply for an exemption must complete and submit the Athletic Department Exemption Form with proper documentation and signatures by the beginning of the season and a fully logged training schedule by the end of the season. The process will also require a consultation with the Athletic Director. There are three types of Physical Education Exemptions that the Athletic Department will consider:

Medical Exemptions
These must be long-term injuries that will prohibit the individual from participating for at least 75% of the particular season. A doctor‚Äôs note must be filed with the Athletic Department and the nurse‚Äôs office.

High-Level Competition
The Athletic Department will grant an exemption to students who pursue a sport that is not offered at Portledge during a particular season. The activity must be competitive in nature, and the level of that competition must be relatively high with a supervising coach or instructor. If an exemption is granted for a student to participate in a sport that is already offered at Portledge School during a different season, the student must participate in that sport at Portledge as well.


Special Athletic Programs
The Athletic Department will consider exemptions for co-curricular activities or special athletic programs that are otherwise unavailable to students at Portledge School. The specialized program must be competitive and meet the required minimum number of minutes per week as communicated by the Athletic Department.

Medical Requirements 
Annual Physical Examination Form
ALL STUDENTS MUST HAVE AN UP TO DATE PHYSICAL EXAM FORM ON FILE WITH THE SCHOOL. This means that each student must have a current physical exam each school year. Students who do not have this form on file will be ineligible to participate in athletic activities and in Physical Education classes, thus resulting in not meeting the NYS mandated requirement for promotion. Any student participating in an interscholastic sport must also submit the Sports Health Update Form prior to each new athletic season. These two forms can be found on the Athletics page of our website (www.portledge.org/athletics). AGAIN, NO STUDENT WILL BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE WITHOUT THESE FORMS ON FILE.

Sports Health Update Form
Interscholastic athletics medical examinations are required to protect the health and safety of the students before participation in strenuous activity and periodically throughout the season as necessary.

Prior to participation in each athletic sports season, all students will be provided a Sports Health Update Form to be completed and signed by the parent/guardian unless a physical exam has been completed within the last 30 days and submitted to the Health Office. Athletes will not be able to participate/practice with their team until this form is on file with the Athletic Office.

Gym Lockers
Those who have gym lockers should be locked at all times since they are highly trafficked areas. No belongings should ever be left outside of lockers.

Awards Assembly and Graduation 
All students in 9th‚Äì12th grades are required to attend the Awards Assemblies and Graduation. These are representative dress code days for students. Because of the importance of these events, any requests to be excused from them must be directed in writing to the Director of Upper School well in advance of the ceremony. Parents are invited and encouraged to attend these functions as Portledge recognizes its outstanding students and its graduating class.

Awards and recognition for excellence in scholarship, leadership, and school spirit are given by the various departments at the Academic Awards Assembly in June.  These awards are presented on the basis of faculty recommendations. Athletic recognition is awarded at the Athletic Awards ceremonies that take place at the end of each season during Town Hall Meetings; award recognition is based on coach‚Äôs recommendations.

Cum Laude membership is awarded at an induction ceremony for selected Juniors and Seniors in the spring. 

At the Graduation exercises, those seniors who are graduating Cum Laude or as Arts or STEAM Scholars are recognized.  Also at Graduation, the major school award, the Portledge Bowl, is awarded by the Trustees upon the vote of the faculty to ‚Äúthat senior who best exemplifies the character and values Portledge holds in highest esteem.‚Äù

Deeded Awards
Other deeded awards, given at either Awards Assembly or Graduation, include the following:

The Slanetz Award
The Slanetz Award is awarded to that member of the Senior Class whose record of academic commendations shows the highest level of achievement throughout their sophomore, junior, and senior years at Portledge, given in the hope that these scholars will apply their intellectual ability to the improvement of the human condition and for the well-being of others.  The recipient is determined by the Upper School Division Director from a weighted tally of the commendations earned at Portledge during the 10th - 12th grades.  Only semester and end-of-year grades are used for this computation. 

The Barbara Lisanne Ayers Memorial Award for Outstanding Scholarship
The Barbara Lisanne Ayers Memorial Award for Outstanding Scholarship is presented annually to that member of the graduating class who, throughout their career at Portledge, has best exemplified the character and achievement of Barbara Lisanne Ayers (Class of 1977) through profound devotion to learning together with a consistently high level of academic accomplishment.

The Head of School‚Äôs Award
The Head‚Äôs Award is given by the Head of School to recognize the unique contributions to the life of the School made by one or more seniors.

The Senior Athletic Awards
The Senior Athletic Awards are presented in recognition of overall contribution to the School‚Äôs athletic program through outstanding effort on behalf of team play and sportsmanship, and excellence in a number of athletic endeavors.

The Bliss Award
The Bliss Award is presented each year to the senior or seniors who have excelled in visual and performing arts.

The Senior Class Award
The Senior Class Award, upon vote of the senior class members, and affirmation of the faculty, is presented to that member of the graduating class who demonstrates a high degree of kindness and generosity towards friends, faculty and the Portledge Community.  

The Student Council Award
The Student Council Award is presented, upon vote of the Council members, to that student who has displayed outstanding dedication in overall school spirit.

The Hahn Environmental Award
The Hahn Environmental Award recognizes the student or students who exhibit extraordinary, exemplary leadership in the field of sustainability, both globally and within the Portledge community.

Books and Supplies
There are two options: 
students may purchase all their textbooks outright, in which case the student owns these books and may make markings in them;
Students may elect to be lent available BOCES textbooks and then be charged for textbooks not available through BOCES.  Books on loan must be returned at the end of the school year in reusable condition, not marked up or overly shopworn.  Students will be billed for lost or seriously damaged texts. 


In either case, students should be sure to put their name in each of their texts. All students are responsible for providing their own pens, pencils, paper and notebooks.

Cafeteria and Food Regulations 
Nuts are not permitted on the Portledge campus.

The cafeteria provides a daily selection of nutritious lunch choices. Lunch is served from approximately 10:40 a.m. to approximately 2:15 p.m. Lunches are to be eaten only in the cafeteria space or outdoors. Lunch may not be eaten in the gym or in the Upper School building. Students are to be respectful in the common areas and to clean up after themselves. No food (including such things as lollipops or chewing gum) is permitted in hallways, air-locks, on Wellington Gym floor, in The Chen Center, or in the Gilmour Library. Food in classrooms is prohibited without the expressed permission of the teacher. Only Seniors may obtain and consume food acquired off campus, but such consumption is restricted to the Senior Lounge. Failure to keep that area clean and free of refuse will result in the swift elimination of this privilege. Students may not order or accept deliveries of take-out orders at school prior to 3:55 p.m.
Parents/Guardians of students with school-related after-school obligations (such as athletic, performing arts, or other events or practices) should feel free to provide their children with snacks and/or other food items for their own children's consumption so that they can be appropriately nourished prior to those after-school obligations. These items must not be shared with any other students and, as is always the case, must not contain nuts or have been processed in a plant with nuts.
 
School Phones
Students are not to use school phones in the offices or library without permission, for this ties up school lines and disrupts the work of faculty and staff. 


Cell Phone Usage
Mobile phones and digital devices are an integral part of our students‚Äô way of life and can have considerable value, particularly in relation to individual safety. These technological tools play a significant part in the educational practices of the 21st century. We encourage the use of laptops in class, but cell phones can never be used as calculators or for class work unless specifically designated by the teacher for academic purposes. The College Board bans them from all testing areas, and their presence will result in a cancellation of scores.

Students will likely not have access to their phones during class, so if you have an urgent message, please call or email the office, and someone will notify the student promptly. Please limit cell phone contact with your child during the school day to only essential or emergency calls or emergency text messages.

If cell phones are used inappropriately, the teacher has the right to confiscate that device for the remainder of the period.  If continued misuse occurs, disciplinary consequences will result. Cell phones or other electronic devices may never be brought into an exam room during a standardized test.

Students will only be allowed to use their cell phones during time periods when they do not have academic responsibilities. If a student abuses their cell phone privileges, a parent/guardian will have to come to school and pick up the phone.

Sexting is dangerous and prohibited and will be considered a serious disciplinary infraction. 

Drills:  Fire, Bus, Emergency 
Fire drills are held periodically during the school year. During the drill, faculty will assemble students alphabetically by grade on an athletic field. Quiet must be maintained!  By State mandate, students have a certain number of bus drills each school year. Portledge also has contingency procedures for various emergency situations.

Lockers and Belongings 
Each Upper School student is assigned a locker with a combination lock. All books, clothing and other supplies may be kept locked in these lockers. Book bags and the like are not to be left in the corridors, nor are they to be hung on the open door of the locker. The student‚Äôs name MUST be on all of their books, computer equipment, and clothing. The school cannot take responsibility for lost, stolen, or missing belongings.  Students should not bring large sums of money or valuables to school. If this is unavoidable, valuables should be deposited in the school office for safekeeping. Students who lose their combination lock will be charged. Only school-issued locks are to be used on the hallway or athletic lockers. The athletic department assigns athletic lockers (and combination locks to them) to all students playing on school teams. Athletic locker rooms are to be used only when changing for physical education or sports. Once any property or belongings are on school property, they are subject to search by the Head of School, Division Director or Assistant Division Director.

Off Limits
During the school day, Upper School students must remain in the Upper School buildings or on the lawns in the immediate vicinity of the Upper and Middle Schools unless they have a scheduled commitment or appointment in the Lower School. Students who remain after school for school-related obligations should not leave campus until a bus or ride takes them home. On the other hand, the school cannot supervise those students who do not have obligations after school.  Instead, they must leave for home rather than hang out on campus.

During the school day, the Upper School parking lot is off-limits to all students except seniors who are in the process of leaving campus or returning to it. The Commons parking lot is always off-limits to students. 

Photocopiers
Office photocopy machines are not for student use.

Specific Mandates
Students listening to electronic devices in the Upper School halls must use earbuds or headphones. At the discretion of teachers and administrators, chewing gum can be prohibited in any place at any time on campus. 

Senior Lounge
It is the responsibility of the senior officers of the Student Council to oversee the maintenance of the Commons Lounge so that it is not abused and to address any other problems concerning the lounge.  Only food and drink from the vending machines may be consumed in the student lounges. Students may not sleep in the lounge. Decorous student behavior with non-distracting noise levels is expected at all times. The Senior Lounge can be closed at the discretion of the Dean of Students, Director of the Upper School, or Head of School. 

Sustainability and Environmental Procedures
Portledge is committed to programs that protect and provide a healthy respect for the environment. To those ends, students, faculty, and parents/guardians are asked to join in efforts to decrease wasteful use of utilities and resources and to practice good habits of recycling. We work together towards the preservation of our earth household.

Wellington Gymnasium
Students with unscheduled periods may use the gym if there is no other class using it at that time and if granted permission by a member of the athletic department. Careful attention to safety is expected at all times. The use of any equipment other than basketballs in the gym, except during a supervised practice, is not allowed. The T-area of the gym may NOT be used as a play area. Similarly, students are not to play ball in the Wellington courtyard. Only sneakers are permitted on the gym floor, never cleats or street shoes. Students should remind fellow players of these rules. Those who do not comply (or who are playing with others not in compliance) will receive a detention notice.
Parent Partnership Clause
Portledge School believes that a positive constructive working relationship between the school and a student‚Äôs parents/guardians is essential to the fulfillment of the school‚Äôs mission. Thus, the school reserves the right not to continue enrollment or not to re-enroll a student if the school reasonably concludes that the actions of a parent/guardian make such a positive and constructive relationship impossible or otherwise seriously interfere with the school‚Äôs accomplishment of its educational purposes.
 
School Event Guidelines 
Note: School regulations are in effect at all school functions (plays, dances, athletic events, etc.), during lunch, on field trips, and during examination periods unless otherwise specified by the Division Director. The Student Council has adopted the following set of rules for social events at school:

All special events (bake sales, raffles, events, etc.) must be approved by the US Dean of Student Leadership, the US Dean of Student Engagement and Citizenship,  and Student Council.  The Faculty Sponsor must submit an event planning request for all events, during and after school, through the School software for approval from the Systems Manager.
Reminder:  Nuts are not permitted on campus at any time.
There will be only one designated entrance and exit to the event.  Other exits are to be used only in the event of an emergency and thus legally cannot be blocked.
Students are expected to remain until the end of the event.  Students who leave early must either be picked up by parents or (if possessing driving privileges) leave in their own cars.  A student who leaves the event must leave campus and may not return later.
Smoking and vaping are not only against team rules for athletes but are also illegal in school buildings and on school grounds.
Students who are found under the influence of alcohol or using or possessing alcohol (or any other illegal or controlled substance) will be subject to the full disciplinary measure of the School and/or the local police.
Students are expected to adhere to all other rules of Portledge, both explicit and implied, that deal with decorous and appropriate behavior.
During the event, the sponsoring class and the chaperones will work in conjunction to maintain appropriate order. Students who pose discipline problems will have their parents called to pick them up.
The sponsoring group must clean up the area immediately following the end of the event.


Chaperones
Functions sponsored by or held at the school for students are under the rules and regulations of Portledge. Such functions must have faculty members or administrators  present as chaperones who assure that the activity occurs within the constraints of school regulations.  Chaperones may require that a student leave a school function if that student is not adhering to the school rules. Under such circumstances, the student‚Äôs parent will be contacted, and the student may also be liable to further action from a member of the Upper School administrative team.

Off-Campus Party Policy  
Any off-campus party not organized by the school (both during the school year and after closing exercises) is therefore not school sanctioned or school supervised in any way. The school does not take responsibility for the parties or sponsor them. Attendance at such parties is the sole responsibility and right of the individual participant, as these are not school events.

Guidelines for Social Activities Outside of School 
The school requests that all Portledge parents/guardians support and adhere to these guidelines: 
When a student party is planned in my home, there will be no alcohol or drugs served or brought in.
I will be home and visible throughout the party and will ask additional adults to be present when hosting a large party.
If a person does bring alcohol or other drugs to the party or arrives at the party showing the effects of alcohol or other drugs, I will discuss it with that person, see that the student reaches home safely, and ensure that the student‚Äôs parents/guardians are aware of the incident.
I will welcome calls or emails from other parents/guardians who are concerned about what is happening when my child has a party: what will be served, who will be there, and what time the party will be over.
If my child is attending a party, I will not hesitate to call the host‚Äôs parents/guardians for information about the party.
If I go out of town overnight or away for the evening and my child will be home, I will make the necessary arrangements to ensure that my home will not be used for a student party.
I will discuss these guidelines in detail with my child.


Computer Use Policy
Computers have become essential tools in the educational process.  At the beginning of the year, students are given instructions concerning the appropriate use of the facilities and machines.  In short, desktop computers are school property and should be used responsibly in line with their educational purposes.  Similarly, it is expected that students will use their laptops at school in an appropriate manner. 

Computers (including laptops), network, and internet access are available to our students in order to enhance and expand their learning opportunities through the use of technology.  We expect students to demonstrate responsible resource-sharing, innovation, and communication. 

Computer use at school may be revoked if a student does not adhere to the guidelines below.

Acceptable Use: The use of computers/laptops, computer peripherals, the internet, and the school network must be in support of learning and research within the educational goals and objectives of Portledge School.  Transmission of any material in violation of any U.S., state, or school regulations is prohibited.   Students should have no expectation of computer privacy, as the school may monitor computers and internet activity. Illegal downloading or use of pirated music or software is prohibited.

Personal Responsibility
Students must accept responsibility for proper use of school technology. Students...
Will respect the privacy and dignity of others at all times and will refrain from any form of cyberbullying.
Will not use another user‚Äôs password.
Will use appropriate language by refraining from profanity or insulting language. 
Will respect school equipment.
Will not access, process or store inappropriate files.


Internet Safety
To ensure student safety on the internet, participants will follow the guidelines below:
Do not give out on the internet personal information such as full name, phone number, or address.
Do not give out on the internet personal information about someone else‚Äôs name, phone number or address.
Only access sites appropriate for school classes or activities.
It is the student‚Äôs responsibility to keep computer viruses off any school equipment.  Student laptops must have current anti-virus software installed and running if their laptops support such software.
Electronic communication among students on or off campus that is considered to be inappropriate in nature and/or intimidating in any way will not be tolerated.  (Offensive messages that originate outside of school but disrupt the school‚Äôs educational process may be subject to consequences at school.) 


Health Information 
Physical Examination 
Annual physical examinations are required for all students who attend Portledge School. Physical examinations are valid for 12 months from the date of the examination. Appointments for new physicals should be made well in advance of the expiration date in order to submit the updated form in time to continue attending school and participating in physical activity.
 
New Students
All new students must provide a completed physical examination form and immunization record before the start of the new academic year.

Returning Students 
Physicals for returning students are valid for one calendar year from the day the exam was performed.  All returning students must submit an updated physical exam form and immunization record before the expiration date of their current physical exam (this date may not coincide with the start of the school year, and a copy is not necessary as all current physical exam forms are kept on file in the Health Office.)

No student will be permitted to attend class or practice on an interscholastic team or participate in physical education unless the school has received the completed health certificate.

Immunization
No child will be admitted to school or allowed to attend school more than fourteen days without appropriate certification of immunization against communicable diseases. Portledge School follows the New York State immunization requirements for school entrance/attendance.
  
New York State‚Äôs immunization requirements for students entering 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades in September will require a record of:
 
Immunization
Number of Doses Required
Polio
3-4 doses
Hepatitis B
2-3 doses appropriately selected and spaced
Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis
4 doses (includes 1 adolescent booster)
Measles/Mumps/Rubella
2 doses
Varicella (Chicken Pox)
2 doses
Meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY)
1 dose for 9th, 10th, & 11th grades

2 doses for 12th grade if first dose received before the age of 16

 
If you have a child entering 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grade in the next school year or who is of comparable age, please contact your child's physician to ensure that your child is in compliance with the current New York State immunization requirements for school attendance.
 
Please be sure the necessary documentation is received by the Health Office prior to your child beginning their new school year.

Prescription Drugs
The School‚Äôs policy on prescription and over-the-counter drugs and/or medicines require parents to fill out the "Medication Authorization Form" that gives permission for either the Nurse or the student to administer appropriate medications indicated on the form, at its designated time.  For safety‚Äôs sake, we must have this information on file, about prescriptions or other drug use, for all students and authorization from parents for the self-administration of any drug by any student, including all standard pain and allergy medications (i.e. Tylenol, Advil, Benadryl, Claritin, etc). In case of any medical emergency, the Nurse and all faculty/staff must be aware of all medications being brought to school to communicate to any attending physician at that time.  As in the past, any medicine that is brought to school MUST be in the appropriate prescription container identifying the medication, the recipient, and the authorizing physician, when applicable. Non-prescription drugs should only be brought in their original containers, as well. Students who will be self-carrying medication are required to bring only the supply of prescription or over the counter medications necessary for one day.

Please keep in mind that some over-the-counter and prescription drugs have become popular and the unauthorized or purposeful misuse of these drugs has become a concern. Some use these drugs for ‚Äúrecreational purposes,‚Äù and we know that the abuses can be significant, habit-forming, and destructive. Some use these drugs for weight-loss purposes ‚Äì a use that can be injurious. The proper use of prescription drugs must be every parent‚Äôs concern, as it is ours. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to significant disciplinary action, if, for example, a student should be found with a supply of pills in an unmarked container.

If your child is to receive or self-administer a prescription drug at School, contact the Nurse‚Äôs office for the necessary forms, or visit the Magnus & Health Forms Resource Board and download the Medication Permission Request Form.  (Phone: (516) 750-3229 Fax: (516) 750-3296).

General Health and Communicable Diseases
Parent cooperation is of great importance in helping the school maintain the best conditions for the health and safety of the children. Children who demonstrate symptoms of illness should stay at home for the day. A child who feels ill at school will visit the school nurse or the main office to be evaluated and parents are notified and, if necessary, asked to pick the child up.

The Health Office is responsible for reporting the following illnesses to the Nassau County Department of Health Bureau of Infectious Diseases on a monthly basis: lice, conjunctivitis, chickenpox, strep throat, scarlet fever, fifth disease, ringworm, mononucleosis, scabies, and flu-like illnesses. Parents will receive a letter from the Health Office if any of the above illnesses are reported in your child‚Äôs class. Certain other illnesses, that are diagnosed by a physician, require additional information. These illnesses are: diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenzae (HIB) and polio (all children are immunized for these diseases). Also included are hepatitis, Lyme disease, meningococcemia and meningitis. Please notify the health office right away if your child is diagnosed with any of these aforementioned illnesses. 

Life-threatening Allergies
For the protection of the growing number of Portledge students with serious peanut/tree-nut allergies, we do not serve peanut butter or nut products in our cafeterias. While other foods - for example, dairy products or seafood - can also cause life-threatening allergic reactions, nuts present a special problem for two reasons: they are the most common culprit in severe food allergies, and they are an oily substance, which makes those allergens especially transferable. To ensure the safety of our students, all outside food should be nut-free. Absolutely no baked goods containing nuts or processed in a plant with nuts may be brought on campus, including birthday or celebration treats. All food items brought to school should have an ingredient label attached.

The elimination of nut products from the school is one part of a broader school-wide program that includes teacher and staff education in responding to allergy emergencies, written medical treatment protocols for highly allergic students at Portledge, and availability of emergency information throughout the campus. All teachers are informed before the start of the school year when a child in their classroom is allergic.

Additional Policies
Portledge Non-Discrimination Policy
Portledge School celebrates diversity and seeks students, faculty, and administrators from all different backgrounds. Portledge does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, immigration status, or socioeconomic status in the administration of admissions, financial assistance, recruitment, or any other school policy or process. 

Portledge School Employee & Student Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, Hazing and Bullying
Portledge School is committed to providing a safe, positive learning and working environment. The School will not tolerate discrimination against or harassment of our applicants, faculty members/employees or students by another employee, supervisor, vendor, student, family member or any third party. Moreover, the School will not tolerate any verbal or physical conduct by an employee, supervisor, vendor, student, family member or any third party which harasses, disrupts, or interferes with the work/learning environment of a School employee or student or which creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment. This policy includes discrimination and/or harassment of any kind, but particularly discrimination/harassment based on race, creed, citizenship, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, victim of domestic violence status, veteran status, prior conviction record, or any other classification protected by federal, state, and local laws and ordinances.
 
Hazing is a form of harassment often involving intimidating banter, criticism or ridicule and is frequently but not always associated with excluding an individual from a group. Portledge will take strong disciplinary steps, up to and including discharge or expulsion, against any employee or student who engages in any type of hazing activity.
 
Harassment as defined in this policy is unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct generally based on protected characteristics which creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work/learning environment that interferes with work/learning performance. Harassment can be verbal (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, or teasing), visual (including gestures, offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, text messages, social media postings or e-mails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone‚Äôs way, etc.) that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual. Such conduct violates this policy, even if it is not unlawful. Because it is difficult to define unlawful harassment, employees and students are expected to behave at all times in a professional and ethical manner.
 
Sexual Harassment 
Portledge School's general policy against harassment includes a prohibition against sexual harassment. The law defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature when either:
 
Submission to or rejection of such conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting that individual's hiring, employment, or status within the School; or
 
Such conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's employment/participation in school or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive school environment.
 
The policy requires each employee and student to exhibit, in conduct and communications, sound judgment and respect for the feelings and sensitivities of every other employee and student. The expectations are the same for all members of the student body in their interaction with each other, the faculty, and the staff.
 
Even when they do not violate the law, harassing or discriminatory conduct violates our policy and is prohibited.

Examples of conduct that violates this policy include:
unwelcome sexual advances, flirtations, advances, leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault, blocking normal movement
requests for sexual favors or demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment
obscene or vulgar gestures, posters, or comments
sexual jokes or comments about a person‚Äôs body, sexual prowess, or sexual deficiencies
propositions, or suggestive or insulting comments of a sexual nature
derogatory cartoons, posters, and drawings
sexually explicit text messages, social media postings, emails or voicemails
uninvited touching of a sexual nature
unwelcome sexually related comments
conversation about one‚Äôs own or someone else‚Äôs sex life
conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, even if the content is not sexual
teasing or other conduct directed toward a person because of the person‚Äôs gender 


All such conduct is unacceptable in the work/learning place and in any work/learning related settings such as a school trip, extra-curricular activity or school social functions, regardless of whether the conduct is engaged in by a faculty member, employee, student, family member or other third party.
 
Reporting Procedures  
The following steps have been put into place to ensure the work and learning environment at Portledge is respectful, professional, and free of harassment.

If a student believes someone has violated this policy, the student should promptly bring the matter to the immediate attention of their Division Director, the Head of School, or any adult on staff with whom they feel comfortable. In the case of young children, parents may act as the reporting party on behalf of the child.

Adults who become aware of known discrimination, sexual harassment, hazing or bullying (‚Äúimproper conduct‚Äù) are responsible for making sure the situation is reported if the student is not comfortable doing so. Failure of an adult to report a known abuse shall be a violation of this policy for which discipline may be imposed. 

If a student or adult in the community is more comfortable reporting a serious incident anonymously, they are encouraged to use our online anonymous reporting system, which can be accessed here: https://www.portledge.org/community/anonymous-reporting. In all instances, if reporters are willing to file reports non-anonymously, these reports create more opportunity for effective investigation and next steps to occur. 

If the student makes a complaint under this policy and has not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days, they should contact the Head of School immediately.
 
Investigation Procedures 
The School will promptly investigate the facts and circumstances of any report of improper conduct. To the extent possible, the School will endeavor to keep the reporting employee‚Äôs or student‚Äôs concerns confidential. During the investigation, the School generally will:
interview the complainant and the alleged harasser
conduct further interviews as necessary
document the School‚Äôs findings regarding the complaint
document recommended follow-up actions and remedies, if warranted
inform the complainant of the School‚Äôs findings


Every employee in a supervisory capacity, who learns of any employee‚Äôs or student‚Äôs concern about conduct in violation of this policy, whether through a formal or informal communication, immediately must report the issues raised to the Head of School.
 
Upon completion of the investigation, the School will take corrective measures against any person who has engaged in conduct in violation of this policy, if the School determines such measures are necessary. These measures may include, but are not limited to, counseling, suspension, expulsion or immediate termination. Anyone, regardless of position, title or standing, whom the School determines has engaged in conduct that violates this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination and expulsion.
No Retaliation 
No employee or student will be subject to any form of discipline or retaliation for reporting perceived violations of this policy, pursuing any such claim, or cooperating in any way in the investigation of such claims. If an employee or student believes someone has violated this no-retaliation policy, the employee or student should bring the matter to the immediate attention of the Head of School. Anyone, regardless of position, title or standing, who the School determines has engaged in conduct that violates this policy against retaliation will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination or expulsion.
 
Portledge cannot remedy claimed harassment or retaliation unless claims are brought to the attention of School administration. Failure to report claims of harassment and/or retaliation prevents the School from taking steps to remedy the problem.

Mandated Reporting
A top priority at Portledge is the safety of all those within our community, especially our students. All school officials must abide by New York State Mandated Reporter Laws. According to the NYS Office of Children and Family Services, ‚ÄúMandated reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or maltreatment when they are presented with a reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or maltreatment in a situation where a child, parent, or other person legally responsible for the child is before the mandated reporter when the mandated reporter is acting in his or her official or professional capacity. ‚ÄúOther person legally responsible‚Äù refers to a guardian, caretaker, or other person 18 years of age or older who is responsible for the care of the child. Maltreatment can also include neglect.‚Äù
 
Portledge Policy on Political Speech and Affiliations in the Classroom
At Portledge, we encourage our employees to be well-versed in current events and expand their knowledge beyond their specific teaching field. Teachers, much like our society at large, likely hold diverse personal political opinions. In the classroom and with students, your first priority as an educator is providing a safe space for our students to learn. However, we recognize that issues and current events are discussed at home and on social media and, therefore, may make their way into the classroom via student conversation. Portledge School is a nonpartisan, politically neutral educational institution that respects and values the diverse and differing perspectives and political opinions of its employees and students. This policy is not intended to interfere with employees‚Äô rights pursuant to Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.

This policy aims to foster an environment where free expression is respected and educational goals are prioritized. By providing clear guidelines, the school ensures that political speech contributes positively to the learning experience without causing disruption or division among students or faculty.
School resources (e.g., email, bulletin boards, facilities) should not be used for political campaigning or activities unless approved for educational purposes that align with the school‚Äôs mission and or curriculum.
Portledge students should not wear clothing that is overtly politically partisan in nature. This includes Friday Dress Down Days.
Clubs and Organizations: Political clubs may be formed with the approval of the administration. These clubs must adhere to school policies and foster respectful discourse.
Model kind behavior online and on social media. Some examples of unkind behaviors are bullying, harassing, humiliating, or upsetting anyone online or with a phone/ electronic device ‚Äì which includes but is not limited to sharing photos, videos, or screenshots, spreading rumors or gossip, or setting up fake profiles. Stand up to those who act unkindly, telling them their behavior is unacceptable at Portledge School and beyond. 
Hate speech is prohibited. Portledge defines hate speech as language that threatens the physical, emotional, or mental well-being of a person. Any language that is in direct violation of the Portledge pillars or targets a person based on their self-identified or perceived race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation is deemed hate speech.
Refrain from acting unkindly to fellow classmates on social media due to their political and religious beliefs. Do not share posts that promote violence or bullying.

Students should be aware that we will hold forums throughout the year to allow for sensitive discussions to take place. Teachers reserve the right to indicate to students that conversations should be further explored at upcoming forums to allow for faculty to continue with intended lessons.

Concerns regarding students‚Äô use of political speech or related activities should be reported to the Dean of Faculty.

Social Media Policy
The use of computers and other communication technology is a privilege, not a right. Regardless of what technology students use, they are expected to conduct themselves appropriately and abide by the School‚Äôs Honor Code. Inappropriate use will result in disciplinary action.
 
The following guidelines provide a foundation for how to use technology as a tool to enhance each student‚Äôs education and the overall learning community at Portledge. Always keep in mind that unkind behavior may lead to consequences.
Portledge‚Äôs use of technology follows expectations of mutual respect and kindness, and encourages positive behavior. The Honor Code applies to the use of school technology, accounts, and internet content at all times, even when students are not on campus.
Model kind behavior online and on social media. Some examples of unkind behaviors are bullying, harassing, humiliating, or upsetting anyone online or with a phone/ electronic device ‚Äì which includes, but is not limited to sharing photos, videos, or screenshots, spreading rumors or gossip, or setting up fake profiles. Stand up to those who act unkindly, telling them that their behavior is unacceptable at Portledge School and beyond. 
Know that the photos, videos, text comments can be saved and shared at random, therefore do not post anything online that students would not want family members, teachers, college admissions officers, or future employers to see.
Respect for others and oneself is fundamental to our inclusive and warm environment. To that end, the privacy of everyone in our community should be paramount. Get permission before filming, photographing, or otherwise recording anyone in the community while on or off campus. Get permission again before posting any recordings online for any reason. This includes the postings of any student(s) or faculty members.
Choose healthy online relationships, and if you ever feel uncomfortable with an online interaction, talk to a trusted adult about your feelings. You have the right to choose your relationships, both virtual and in real life. 
Posing as anyone else online, whether as a joke or to gain an advantage, is fundamentally wrong and dishonest. Knowing anyone else‚Äôs password without telling them ‚Äì even if you do not use it ‚Äì falls into this category. 
Other people‚Äôs devices are to be treated as you would like them to treat your devices. Return them to their owners when you find them out of place. Leave the information on them alone. If you see others violating the Honor Code, speak to them about it. 


Under any circumstances, Portledge School, if it so chooses, may exercise its right to protect its reputation by taking disciplinary measures whenever it deems necessary where conduct is unbecoming of a Portledge student either online or in real life. All violations of the Social Media Policy could result in disciplinary consequences when brought to the school‚Äôs attention.

Policy Regarding Instagram Accounts and Student-Created Websites
Portledge has  two official Instagram accounts representing Portledge (Portledge School and Portledge Sports) These are the only accounts sanctioned by the Communications Department to represent our community under the Portledge name. While we absolutely appreciate your enthusiasm and love for our school, we have noticed some challenges with several student accounts being created for clubs and teams. These accounts are unsanctioned and are inconsistent with our branding, and lower engagement on our main page as a result. 

We want to ensure that our school's online presence accurately reflects our values and identity. Going forward, whether you have a club posting, a candid moment in class, or anything else you want to share, we‚Äôd be more than happy to coordinate with you on posting on our social media. Simply contact us at communications@portledge.org with photos/video and a suggested caption and we will make sure to feature this on the Portledge account. 

We realized that some classes may suggest or require that a website be created to showcase your work. Please be sure to share access with the Communications department for any public websites using our name and branding. 

Let‚Äôs work together to showcase the best of Portledge while having the most cohesive online presence. Your partnership will allow us to highlight the student experience at Portledge with higher engagement.

School Policy on Recording Others Without Explicit Permission
Portledge School is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students and staff. Recording others without their explicit permission can create a hostile learning environment and violate student and staff privacy. 

Students and staff are prohibited from recording others without their explicit permission. This includes recording others in person or through the use of electronic devices. This policy includes the prohibition of audio recording, video recording, or taking photographs without the explicit permission of subjects. This policy applies to all students and staff while they are on school property or at school-sponsored events. This includes classrooms, hallways, cafeterias, restrooms, locker rooms, athletic fields, and buses; this list of included venues of forums is not exhaustive. Please note that media legitimately obtained by the School is covered and governed by the annual Media Release and therefore not subject to the prohibitions detailed above. Please also note that if an individual persists in recording or photographing anyone who has asked that the action stop, consequences for that individual may be more serious.

Any student or staff member who violates this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, or termination, as appropriate. Students and staff who believe that this policy has been violated should report the incident to a teacher, administrator, or other trusted adult immediately. Indeed, the school encourages such reporting, The school administration will investigate all reported violations of this policy. If the school administration determines that a violation has occurred, the student or staff member may be subject to disciplinary action.

Portledge School is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students and staff. By following this policy, we can continue to create and cultivate a school community where our pillars govern and undergird our policies and practices.

Eligibility for Promotion Policies
Portledge School offers contracts to individual students on a yearly basis.  It does not offer multiple year contracts and maintains its right to non-renewal of a contract at its discretion (as outlined in the wording of the contract itself). While Portledge aspires to do all it can to meet the academic and social and emotional needs of an individual child, there are times when we come to recognize that the student would be better or best served in a different educational environment, or that the student and/or family consistently behave in a way that is out of sympathy with our community and our pillars. 

Under these circumstances, the School deems it necessary to withhold a contract or not offer a contract for the upcoming year as it determines that the student may be ineligible for promotion to the next grade.

When becoming ineligible for promotion is even a possibility, Portledge School will strive to inform a family of this possibility by way of personal phone call/conference meeting by the end of the first semester (if not before then), to outline the nature of the concerns and areas to be addressed, and then follow up with a recap of this notification in writing. If difficulties continue or have not been rectified for whatever reason, then the school will make the difficult decision to not offer the involved family a contract for the following year. The school endeavors whenever possible to reach these decisions and inform families as early as possible, oftentimes by January or February, so as to allow families sufficient time to create alternative plans for the next school year.

Contract ineligibility could be related to but is not limited to the following scenarios:
Academic performance, ability or effort (division specific, as defined in the handbook)
Behavioral problems that result in serious or ongoing disciplinary infractions or that are disruptive to the learning of the child in question or that of other children in the learning environment (including but not limited to peer cruelty and bullying)
Criminal activity (resulting in prosecution) that is known to have taken place outside school
Chronic and persistent attendance issues (as outlined in the handbook)
Significant social, learning and/or emotional needs that the school is not able to meet or accommodate with its current resources
Any other reason deemed sufficient to result in a child being required to transition out of Portledge. 


In addition, a student‚Äôs success at Portledge requires strong positive collaboration between the student‚Äôs parents/guardians and the school‚Äôs administration and faculty. There are rare occasions when it is the parent(s)/guardian(s), not the student, who are unwilling or unable to meet the basic requirements of the expected Parent Partnership document. This scenario, if unresolved or ongoing may also result in non-renewal of contract for an individual student. Failure to sign, or refusal to sign the aforementioned Parent Partnership document does not negate the fact that basic tenets of respect and courtesy form the non-negotiable cornerstone of how we conduct ourselves in the Portledge community and will therefore always apply.  

Re-Enrollment Committee (REC)
The purpose of the Re-Enrollment Committee (REC) will be to monitor and enforce the standards created by the school for student eligibility for promotion. 

When reviewing a student‚Äôs eligibility for re-enrollment the REC will be evaluating the individual‚Äôs academic and behavioral performance, attendance patterns, and compliance with the parent-student-school partnership. At various times the Committee will be made up of the following members:
Directors of Lower, Middle and Upper School
Director of Admissions
Director of Financial Aid
Educational Psychologist
Homeroom Teacher or Advisor

Academic Standards 	
Criteria for review:
A student's academic standing will be reviewed at each interim and marking period. The Committee will consider the academic marks the student receives, narrative reports, effort marks and be looking to identify students who are performing in a marginal relationship to grade level standards. 

In the Lower School, the focus of the review will be Math and English language arts. As the student moves into the departmentalized program of the Middle and Upper school all core courses will be considered.

For Lower and Middle School students, any standardized tests that the school conducts in 3rd - 6th grade will also be utilized for additional objective data to determine a student‚Äôs performance and aptitude in relation to grade level norms.

For the Middle School, all grades must be passing, and there must be no marks of F. 

The Upper School review will utilize the ‚ÄúAcademic Standing‚Äù guidelines outlined earlier in this document including: ‚Äúto progress to the next grade, and to be considered for a Portledge diploma, a student must earn no fewer than five credits each year and have no failures in required courses. At the end of each semester, any student with two D‚Äôs, three C‚Äôs, or with a failing grade in any course, is considered for placement on  Academic Warning.‚Äù

An additional review will occur in the year in advance of a student's matriculation from one division to the next to ensure the appropriateness of the program and also to provide families ample time to consider placement. 

Portledge offers reasonable accommodations to those with documented needs. Our Educational Psychologist, Learning Specialist, and Learning Needs Committee meet to coordinate accommodations and are involved in monitoring performance.
Process of Student Academic Review
If REC deems a student in poor standing in relation to the above, the student will be placed on Academic Warning, the family will be notified directly both via phone and email correspondence that clearly identifies the reason for placement on Academic Warning. 

The communication will also provide a detailed list of the supports the school will be putting in place to help the student raise performance, along with identifying a timeline for updating along with a date for a formal review of status.

The REC will be responsible for conducting all student reviews at the interim and end of marking periods, with the largest review taking place after the first semester in order to give the student time for improvement and the family time to consider alternative placement options.

Updates on performance will happen at the next academic reporting period, either an interim or end of the semester. 

Final decisions will be made on an individual basis.

Behavioral Standards
Criteria for Review:
A student‚Äôs behavior will also be a component of a student‚Äôs review to be eligible for promotion. Portledge is guided by our character code and the pillars of citizenship that include Kindness, Honor, Purpose, and Respect. 

A student with persistent infractions of any sort, or who has been suspended, would be in jeopardy of being placed on Disciplinary Warning and thus be subject to review by the REC. 

Additionally, any student whose behavior within the learning environment is deemed consistently disruptive and thus inhibiting others from learning would also be seen in violation of the behavioral standards for promotion and would be placed under review by the Re-enrollment Committee. 

Process of Student Behavioral Review
A student‚Äôs behavior is evaluated daily. Any major deviation and or major breach of conduct can place a student under immediate review by this committee. Minor infractions that either accumulate or develop a consistent frequency will also be deemed in violation of the code of conduct.

Placement on Disciplinary Warning may occur at any moment based on student behavior and will be reviewed at each marking period.

When a student is placed on Disciplinary Warning, the family will be notified directly both via phone and email correspondence that clearly identifies the reason for placement on Disciplinary Warning.

The communication will also provide a detailed list of the support the school will be putting in place to help the student raise performance, along with identifying a timeline for a formal review.

The REC will conduct these reviews at the interim and end of marking periods, with the largest review taking place after the first semester in order to give the student time for improvement and the family time to consider alternative placement options.

Updates on performance will happen at the next academic mile marker, either an interim or end of the semester. 

Final decisions will be made on an individual basis.

Compliance with Parent-Student-School Partnership 
Portledge School believes that a positive constructive working relationship between the school, the student and the school and a student‚Äôs parents/guardians is essential to the fulfillment of the school‚Äôs mission. Thus, the school reserves the right not to continue enrollment or not to re-enroll a student if the school reasonably concludes that the actions of a student or parent/guardian make such a positive and constructive relationship impossible or otherwise seriously interfere with the school‚Äôs accomplishment of its educational purposes. 

Dogs on Campus
For the safety and wellbeing of our community, Portledge School does not permit dogs when students are on campus, as dogs may constitute real or perceived health issues to others. Such issues may include allergies, fear, falls, and bites, and our younger students may be especially susceptible. 

Security Video Footage Use
Portledge School takes the safety and security of all of the community members extremely seriously.  Indeed, it is a fundamental expectation that students (and adults) should come to school knowing that we are aspiring to do all we can to create a ‚Äúwarm and inclusive community‚Äù as our mission statement says.

To this end, Portledge operates a monitoring system using exclusive indoor and outdoor cameras. These cameras are able to capture almost all areas of the campus.  The footage that is captured is kept for a period of 30 days, and then (unless deemed necessary to save by security personnel) is erased from our server.  The content of this material is solely in the possession of the school and will not be made available to parents/guardians or other potentially interested parties for any reason or under any circumstances (unless required to do so by law).  This measure is taken to protect the privacy of all individuals and grants our school the ability to maintain this footage for its sole use.

Please be advised that video surveillance is only used in common areas and not in areas where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as restrooms, locker rooms, etc.
